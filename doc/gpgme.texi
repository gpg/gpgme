@node Introduction
@chapter Introduction

`GnuPG Made Easy' (@acronym{GPGME}) is a C language library that
allows to add support for cryptography to a program.  It is designed
to make access to public key crypto engines like GnuPG or GpgSM easier
for applications.  @acronym{GPGME} provides a high-level crypto API
for encryption, decryption, signing, signature verification and key
management.

@acronym{GPGME} uses GnuPG and GpgSM as its backends to support
OpenPGP and the Cryptographic Message Syntax (CMS).

@node Getting Started
@section Getting Started

This manual documents the @acronym{GPGME} library programming
interface.  All functions and data types provided by the library are
explained.

The reader is assumed to possess basic knowledge about cryptography in
general, and public key cryptography in particular.  The underlying
cryptographic engines that are used by the library are not explained,
but where necessary, special features or requirements by an engine are
mentioned as far as they are relevant to @acronym{GPGME} or its users.

This manual can be used in several ways.  If read from the beginning
to the end, it gives a good introduction into the library and how it
can be used in an application.  Forward references are included where
necessary.  Later on, the manual can be used as a reference manual to
get just the information needed about any particular interface of the
library.  Experienced programmers might want to start looking at the
examples at the end of the manual, and then only read up those parts
of the interface which are unclear.

The documentation for the language bindings is currently not included
in this manual.  Those languages bindings follow the general
programming model of @acronym{GPGME} but may provide some extra high
level abstraction on top of the @acronym{GPGME} style API.  For now
please see the README files in the @file{lang/} directory of the
source distribution.


@node Features
@section Features

@acronym{GPGME} has a couple of advantages over other libraries doing
a similar job, and over implementing support for GnuPG or other crypto
engines into your application directly.

@table @asis
@item it's free software
Anybody can use, modify, and redistribute it under the terms of the GNU
Lesser General Public License (@pxref{Library Copying}).

@item it's flexible
@acronym{GPGME} provides transparent support for several cryptographic
protocols by different engines.  Currently, @acronym{GPGME} supports
the OpenPGP protocol using GnuPG as the backend, and the Cryptographic
Message Syntax using GpgSM as the backend.

@item it's easy
@acronym{GPGME} hides the differences between the protocols and
engines from the programmer behind an easy-to-use interface.  This way
the programmer can focus on the other parts of the program, and still
integrate strong cryptography in his application.  Once support for
@acronym{GPGME} has been added to a program, it is easy to add support
for other crypto protocols once @acronym{GPGME} backends provide them.

@item it's language friendly
@acronym{GPGME} comes with languages bindings for several common
programming languages: Common Lisp, C++, Python 2, and Python 3.
@end table

@node Overview
@section Overview

@acronym{GPGME} provides a data abstraction that is used to pass data
to the crypto engine, and receive returned data from it.  Data can be
read from memory or from files, but it can also be provided by a
callback function.

The actual cryptographic operations are always set within a context.
A context provides configuration parameters that define the behaviour
of all operations performed within it.  Only one operation per context
is allowed at any time, but when one operation is finished, you can
run the next operation in the same context.  There can be more than
one context, and all can run different operations at the same time.

Furthermore, @acronym{GPGME} has rich key management facilities
including listing keys, querying their attributes, generating,
importing, exporting and deleting keys, and acquiring information
about the trust path.

With some precautions, @acronym{GPGME} can be used in a multi-threaded
environment, although it is not completely thread safe and thus needs
the support of the application.


@node Preparation
@chapter Preparation

To use @acronym{GPGME}, you have to perform some changes to your
sources and the build system.  The necessary changes are small and
explained in the following sections.  At the end of this chapter, it
is described how the library is initialized, and how the requirements
of the library are verified.

@node Header
@section Header
@cindex header file
@cindex include file

All interfaces (data types and functions) of the library are defined
in the header file `gpgme.h'.  You must include this in all programs
using the library, either directly or through some other header file,
like this:

@example
#include <gpgme.h>
@end example

The name space of @acronym{GPGME} is @code{gpgme_*} for function names
and data types and @code{GPGME_*} for other symbols.  Symbols internal
to @acronym{GPGME} take the form @code{_gpgme_*} and @code{_GPGME_*}.

Because @acronym{GPGME} makes use of the GPG Error library, using
@acronym{GPGME} will also use the @code{GPG_ERR_*} name space
directly, and the @code{gpg_err*}, @code{gpg_str*}, and @code{gpgrt_*}
name space indirectly.


@node Building the Source
@section Building the Source
@cindex compiler options
@cindex compiler flags

If you want to compile a source file including the `gpgme.h' header
file, you must make sure that the compiler can find it in the
directory hierarchy.  This is accomplished by adding the path to the
directory in which the header file is located to the compilers include
file search path (via the @option{-I} option).

However, the path to the include file is determined at the time the
source is configured.  To solve this problem, gpgme ships with
@code{gpgme.pc} file, that knows about the path to the include file
and other configuration options.  The command, @command{pkg-config},
can be used to handle information with @code{gpgme.pc} file.  In an
environment which doesn't have @command{pkg-config} (like the one in
early stage of OS bootstrap), for Automake, you can use
@code{gpgme.m4} which invokes @command{gpgrt-config} with
@code{gpgme.pc}.  (In the past, gpgme used to ship with a small helper
program @command{gpgme-config}.  This functionality of
@command{gpgme-config} is replaced by @command{pkg-config} with
@code{gpgme.pc} file.)

The options that need to be added to the compiler invocation at
compile time are output by the @option{--cflags} option to
@command{pkg-config gpgme}.  The following example shows how it can be
used at the command line:

@example
gcc -c foo.c `pkg-config --cflags gpgme`
@end example

Adding the output of @samp{pkg-config --cflags gpgme} to the compiler
command line will ensure that the compiler can find the
@acronym{GPGME} header file.

A similar problem occurs when linking the program with the library.
Again, the compiler has to find the library files.  For this to work,
the path to the library files has to be added to the library search
path (via the @option{-L} option).  For this, the option
@option{--libs} to @command{pkg-config gpgme} can be used.  For
convenience, this option also outputs all other options that are
required to link the program with @acronym{GPGME} (in particular, the
@samp{-lgpgme} option).  The example shows how to link @file{foo.o}
with the @acronym{GPGME} library to a program @command{foo}.

@example
gcc -o foo foo.o `pkg-config --libs gpgme`
@end example

Of course you can also combine both examples to a single command by
specifying both options to @command{pkg-config gpgme}:

@example
gcc -o foo foo.c `pkg-config --cflags --libs gpgme`
@end example

@c
@c Feature not available by pkg-config/gpgrt-config

@node Largefile Support (LFS)
@section Largefile Support (LFS)
@cindex largefile support
@cindex LFS

@acronym{GPGME} is compiled with largefile support by default, if it
is available on the system.  This means that GPGME supports files
larger than two gigabyte in size, if the underlying operating system
can.  On some systems, largefile support is already the default.  On
such systems, nothing special is required.  However, some systems
provide only support for files up to two gigabyte in size by default.
Support for larger file sizes has to be specifically enabled.

To make a difficult situation even more complex, such systems provide
two different types of largefile support.  You can either get all
relevant functions replaced with alternatives that are largefile
capable, or you can get new functions and data types for largefile
support added.  Those new functions have the same name as their
smallfile counterparts, but with a suffix of 64.

An example: The data type @code{off_t} is 32 bit wide on GNU/Linux PC
systems.  To address offsets in large files, you can either enable
largefile support add-on.  Then a new data type @code{off64_t} is
provided, which is 64 bit wide.  Or you can replace the existing
@code{off_t} data type with its 64 bit wide counterpart.  All
occurrences of @code{off_t} are then automagically replaced.

As if matters were not complex enough, there are also two different
types of file descriptors in such systems.  This is important because
if file descriptors are exchanged between programs that use a
different maximum file size, certain errors must be produced on some
file descriptors to prevent subtle overflow bugs from occurring.

As you can see, supporting two different maximum file sizes at the
same time is not at all an easy task.  However, the maximum file size
does matter for @acronym{GPGME}, because some data types it uses in
its interfaces are affected by that.  For example, the @code{off_t}
data type is used in the @code{gpgme_data_seek} function, to match its
@acronym{POSIX} counterpart.  This affects the call-frame of the
function, and thus the ABI of the library.  Furthermore, file
descriptors can be exchanged between GPGME and the application.

For you as the user of the library, this means that your program must
be compiled in the same file size mode as the library.  Luckily, there
is absolutely no valid reason for new programs to not enable largefile
support by default and just use that.  The compatibility modes (small
file sizes or dual mode) can be considered an historic artefact, only
useful to allow for a transitional period.

On POSIX platforms @acronym{GPGME} is compiled using largefile support
by default.  This means that your application must do the same, at
least as far as it is relevant for using the @file{gpgme.h} header
file.  All types in this header files refer to their largefile
counterparts, if they are different from any default types on the
system.

On 32 and 64 bit Windows platforms @code{off_t} is declared as 32 bit
signed integer.  There is no specific support for LFS in the C
library.  The recommendation from Microsoft is to use the native
interface (@code{CreateFile} et al.) for large files.  Released binary
versions of @acronym{GPGME} (libgpgme-11.dll) have always been build
with a 32 bit @code{off_t}.  To avoid an ABI break we stick to this
convention for 32 bit Windows by using @code{long} there.
@acronym{GPGME} versions for 64 bit Windows have never been released
and thus we are able to use @code{int64_t} instead of @code{off_t}
there.  For easier migration the typedef @code{gpgme_off_t} has been
defined.  The reason we cannot use @code{off_t} directly is that some
toolchains (e.g. mingw64) introduce a POSIX compatible hack for
@code{off_t}.  Some widely used toolkits make use of this hack and in
turn @acronym{GPGME} would need to use it also.  However, this would
introduce an ABI break and existing software making use of libgpgme
might suffer from a severe break.  Thus with version 1.4.2 we
redefined all functions using @code{off_t} to use @code{gpgme_off_t}
which is defined as explained above.  This way we keep the ABI well
defined and independent of any toolchain hacks.  The bottom line is
that LFS support in @acronym{GPGME} is only available on 64 bit
versions of Windows.

On POSIX platforms you can enable largefile support, if it is
different from the default on the system the application is compiled
on, by using the Autoconf macro @code{AC_SYS_LARGEFILE}.  If you do
this, then you don't need to worry about anything else: It will just
work.  In this case you might also want to use @code{AC_FUNC_FSEEKO}
to take advantage of some new interfaces, and @code{AC_TYPE_OFF_T}
(just in case).

If you do not use Autoconf, you can define the preprocessor symbol
@code{_FILE_OFFSET_BITS} to 64 @emph{before} including any header
files, for example by specifying the option
@code{-D_FILE_OFFSET_BITS=64} on the compiler command line.  You will
also want to define the preprocessor symbol @code{LARGEFILE_SOURCE} to
1 in this case, to take advantage of some new interfaces.

If you do not want to do either of the above, you probably know enough
about the issue to invent your own solution.  Just keep in mind that
the @acronym{GPGME} header file expects that largefile support is
enabled, if it is available.  In particular, we do not support dual
mode (@code{_LARGEFILE64_SOURCE}).


@node Using Automake
@section Using Automake
@cindex automake
@cindex autoconf

It is much easier if you use GNU Automake instead of writing your own
Makefiles.  If you do that you do not have to worry about finding and
invoking the @command{pkg-config} script at all.  @acronym{GPGME}
provides an extension to Automake that does all the work for you.

@c A simple macro for optional variables.
@macro ovar{varname}
@r{[}@var{\varname\}@r{]}
@end macro
@defmac AM_PATH_GPGME (@ovar{minimum-version}, @ovar{action-if-found}, @ovar{action-if-not-found})
Check whether @acronym{GPGME} (at least version @var{minimum-version},
if given) exists on the host system.  If it is found, execute

given.

This macro locates for @code{gpgme.pc}, with cross-compile support.

Additionally, the function defines @code{GPGME_CFLAGS} to the flags
needed for compilation of the program to find the @file{gpgme.h}
header file, and @code{GPGME_LIBS} to the linker flags needed to link

@node Library Version Check
@section Library Version Check
@cindex version check, of the library

@deftypefun {const char *} gpgme_check_version (@w{const char *@var{required_version}})
The function @code{gpgme_check_version} has four purposes.  It can be
used to retrieve the version number of the library.  In addition it
can verify that the version number is higher than a certain required
version number.  In either case, the function initializes some
sub-systems, and for this reason alone it must be invoked early in
your program, before you make use of the other functions in
@acronym{GPGME}.  The last purpose is to run selftests.

As a side effect for W32 based systems, the socket layer will get
initialized.


If @var{required_version} is @code{NULL}, the function returns a
pointer to a statically allocated string containing the version number
of the library.

If @var{required_version} is not @code{NULL}, it should point to a
string containing a version number, and the function checks that the
version of the library is at least as high as the version number
provided.  In this case, the function returns a pointer to a
statically allocated string containing the version number of the
library.  If @var{REQUIRED_VERSION} is not a valid version number, or
if the version requirement is not met, the function returns
@code{NULL}.

If you use a version of a library that is backwards compatible with
older releases, but contains additional interfaces which your program
uses, this function provides a run-time check if the necessary
features are provided by the installed version of the library.

If a selftest fails, the function may still succeed.  Selftest errors
are returned later when invoking @code{gpgme_new} or
@code{gpgme-data_new}, so that a detailed error code can be returned
(historically, @code{gpgme_check_version} does not return a detailed
error code).
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun {int} gpgme_set_global_flag  @
            (@w{const char *@var{name}}, @
            @w{const char *@var{value}})

@since{1.4.0}

On some systems it is not easy to set environment variables and thus
hard to use @acronym{GPGME}'s internal trace facility for debugging.
This function has been introduced as an alternative way to enable
debugging and for a couple of other rarely used tweaks.  It is
important to assure that only one thread accesses @acronym{GPGME}
functions between a call to this function and after the return from
the call to @code{gpgme_check_version}.

All currently supported features require that this function is called
as early as possible --- even before @code{gpgme_check_version}.  The
features are identified by the following values for @var{name}:

@table @code
@item debug
To enable debugging use the string ``debug'' for @var{name} and
@var{value} identical to the value used with the environment variable
@code{GPGME_DEBUG}.

@item disable-gpgconf
Using this feature with any @var{value} disables the detection of the
gpgconf program and thus forces GPGME to fallback into the simple
OpenPGP only mode.  It may be used to force the use of GnuPG-1 on
systems which have both GPG versions installed.  Note that in general
the use of @code{gpgme_set_engine_info} is a better way to select a
specific engine version.

@item gpgconf-name
@itemx gpg-name
Set the name of the gpgconf respective gpg binary.  The defaults are
@code{GNU/GnuPG/gpgconf} and @code{GNU/GnuPG/gpg}.  Under Unix the
leading directory part is ignored.  Under Windows the leading
directory part is used as the default installation directory; the
@code{.exe} suffix is added by GPGME.  Use forward slashed even under
Windows.

@item require-gnupg
Set the minimum version of the required GnuPG engine.  If that version
is not met, GPGME fails early instead of trying to use the existent
version.  The given version must be a string with major, minor, and
micro number.  Example: "2.1.0".

@item inst-type
The installation type is used to prefer a certain GnuPG installation.
The value is interpreted as an integer: A value of 0 is ignored, a
value of 1 indicates an installation scheme as used by Gpg4win, a
value of 2 indicates an installation scheme as used by GnuPG Desktop
on Windows.  All other values are reserved.

@item w32-inst-dir
On Windows GPGME needs to know its installation directory to find its
spawn helper.  This is in general no problem because a DLL has this
information.  Some applications however link statically to GPGME and
thus GPGME can only figure out the installation directory of this
application which may be wrong in certain cases.  By supplying an
installation directory as value to this flag, GPGME will assume that
that directory is the installation directory.  This flag has no effect
on non-Windows platforms.

@end table

This function returns @code{0} on success.  In contrast to other
functions the non-zero return value on failure does not convey any
error code.  For setting ``debug'' the only possible error cause is an
out of memory condition; which would exhibit itself later anyway.
Thus the return value may be ignored.
@end deftypefun


After initializing @acronym{GPGME}, you should set the locale
information to the locale required for your output terminal.  This
locale information is needed for example for the curses and Gtk
pinentry.  Here is an example of a complete initialization:

@example
#include <locale.h>
#include <gpgme.h>

void
init_gpgme (void)
@{
  /* Initialize the locale environment.  */
  setlocale (LC_ALL, "");
  gpgme_check_version (NULL);
  gpgme_set_locale (NULL, LC_CTYPE, setlocale (LC_CTYPE, NULL));
#ifdef LC_MESSAGES
  gpgme_set_locale (NULL, LC_MESSAGES, setlocale (LC_MESSAGES, NULL));
#endif
@}
@end example

Note that you are highly recommended to initialize the locale settings
like this.  @acronym{GPGME} can not do this for you because it would
not be thread safe.  The conditional on LC_MESSAGES is only necessary
for portability to W32 systems.


@node Signal Handling
@section Signal Handling
@cindex signals
@cindex signal handling

The @acronym{GPGME} library communicates with child processes (the
crypto engines).  If a child process dies unexpectedly, for example
due to a bug, or system problem, a @code{SIGPIPE} signal will be
delivered to the application.  The default action is to abort the
program.  To protect against this, @code{gpgme_check_version} sets the
@code{SIGPIPE} signal action to @code{SIG_IGN}, which means that the
signal will be ignored.

@acronym{GPGME} will only do that if the signal action for
@code{SIGPIPE} is @code{SIG_DEF} at the time
@code{gpgme_check_version} is called.  If it is something different,
@code{GPGME} will take no action.

This means that if your application does not install any signal
handler for @code{SIGPIPE}, you don't need to take any precautions.
If you do install a signal handler for @code{SIGPIPE}, you must be
prepared to handle any @code{SIGPIPE} events that occur due to
@acronym{GPGME} writing to a defunct pipe.  Furthermore, if your
application is multi-threaded, and you install a signal action for
@code{SIGPIPE}, you must make sure you do this either before
@code{gpgme_check_version} is called or afterwards.


@node Multi-Threading
@section Multi-Threading
@cindex thread-safeness
@cindex multi-threading

The @acronym{GPGME} library is mostly thread-safe, and can be used
in a multi-threaded environment but there are some requirements
for multi-threaded use:

@itemize @bullet
@item
The function @code{gpgme_check_version} must be called before any
other function in the library, because it initializes the thread
support subsystem in @acronym{GPGME}.  To achieve this in
multi-threaded programs, you must synchronize the memory with respect
to other threads that also want to use @acronym{GPGME}.  For this, it
is sufficient to call @code{gpgme_check_version} before creating the
other threads using @acronym{GPGME}@footnote{At least this is true for
POSIX threads, as @code{pthread_create} is a function that
synchronizes memory with respects to other threads.  There are many
functions which have this property, a complete list can be found in
POSIX, IEEE Std 1003.1-2003, Base Definitions, Issue 6, in the
definition of the term ``Memory Synchronization''.  For other thread
packages other, more relaxed or more strict rules may apply.}.

@item
Any @code{gpgme_data_t} and @code{gpgme_ctx_t} object must only be
accessed by one thread at a time.  If multiple threads want to deal
with the same object, the caller has to make sure that operations on
that object are fully synchronized.

@item
Only one thread at any time is allowed to call @code{gpgme_wait}.  If
multiple threads call this function, the caller must make sure that
all invocations are fully synchronized.  It is safe to start
asynchronous operations while a thread is running in gpgme_wait.

@item
The function @code{gpgme_strerror} is not thread safe.  You have to
use @code{gpgme_strerror_r} instead.

@acronym{GPGME} supports several cryptographic protocols, however, it
does not implement them.  Rather it uses backends (also called
engines) which implement the protocol.  @acronym{GPGME} uses
inter-process communication to pass data back and forth between the
application and the backend, but the details of the communication
protocol and invocation of the backend is completely hidden by the
interface.  All complexity is handled by @acronym{GPGME}.  Where an

@node Error Handling
@chapter Error Handling
@cindex error handling

Many functions in @acronym{GPGME} can return an error if they fail.
For this reason, the application should always catch the error
condition and take appropriate measures, for example by releasing the
resources and passing the error up to the caller, or by displaying a
descriptive message to the user and cancelling the operation.

Some error values do not indicate a system error or an error in the
operation, but the result of an operation that failed properly.  For
example, if you try to decrypt a tempered message, the decryption will
fail.  Another error value actually means that the end of a data
buffer or list has been reached.  The following descriptions explain
for many error codes what they mean usually.  Some error values have
specific meanings if returned by a certain functions.  Such cases are
described in the documentation of those functions.

@acronym{GPGME} uses the @code{libgpg-error} library.  This allows to
share the error codes with other components of the GnuPG system, and
thus pass error values transparently from the crypto engine, or some
helper application of the crypto engine, to the user.  This way no
information is lost.  As a consequence, @acronym{GPGME} does not use
its own identifiers for error codes, but uses those provided by
@code{libgpg-error}.  They usually start with @code{GPG_ERR_}.

However, @acronym{GPGME} does provide aliases for the functions
defined in libgpg-error, which might be preferred for name space
consistency.

@deftp {Data type} {gpgme_err_code_t}
The @code{gpgme_err_code_t} type is an alias for the @code{libgpg-error}
type @code{gpg_err_code_t}.  The error code indicates the type of an
error, or the reason why an operation failed.

A list of important error codes can be found in the next section.
@end deftp

@deftp {Data type} {gpgme_err_source_t}
The @code{gpgme_err_source_t} type is an alias for the
@code{libgpg-error} type @code{gpg_err_source_t}.  The error source
has not a precisely defined meaning.  Sometimes it is the place where
the error happened, sometimes it is the place where an error was
encoded into an error value.  Usually the error source will give an
indication to where to look for the problem.  This is not always true,
but it is attempted to achieve this goal.

A list of important error sources can be found in the next section.
@end deftp

@deftp {Data type} {gpgme_error_t}
The @code{gpgme_error_t} type is an alias for the @code{libgpg-error}
type @code{gpg_error_t}.  An error value like this has always two
components, an error code and an error source.  Both together form the
error value.

Thus, the error value can not be directly compared against an error
code, but the accessor functions described below must be used.
However, it is guaranteed that only 0 is used to indicate success
(@code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR}), and that in this case all other parts of
the error value are set to 0, too.

Note that in @acronym{GPGME}, the error source is used purely for
diagnostical purposes.  Only the error code should be checked to test
for a certain outcome of a function.  The manual only documents the
error code part of an error value.  The error source is left
unspecified and might be anything.
@end deftp

@deftypefun {static inline gpgme_err_code_t} gpgme_err_code (@w{gpgme_error_t @var{err}})
The static inline function @code{gpgme_err_code} returns the
@code{gpgme_err_code_t} component of the error value @var{err}.  This
function must be used to extract the error code from an error value in
order to compare it with the @code{GPG_ERR_*} error code macros.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {static inline gpgme_err_source_t} gpgme_err_source (@w{gpgme_error_t @var{err}})
The static inline function @code{gpgme_err_source} returns the
@code{gpgme_err_source_t} component of the error value @var{err}.  This
function must be used to extract the error source from an error value in
order to compare it with the @code{GPG_ERR_SOURCE_*} error source macros.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {static inline gpgme_error_t} gpgme_err_make (@w{gpgme_err_source_t @var{source}}, @w{gpgme_err_code_t @var{code}})
The static inline function @code{gpgme_err_make} returns the error
value consisting of the error source @var{source} and the error code
@var{code}.

This function can be used in callback functions to construct an error
value to return it to the library.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {static inline gpgme_error_t} gpgme_error (@w{gpgme_err_code_t @var{code}})
The static inline function @code{gpgme_error} returns the error value
consisting of the default error source and the error code @var{code}.

For @acronym{GPGME} applications, the default error source is
@code{GPG_ERR_SOURCE_USER_1}.  You can define
@code{GPGME_ERR_SOURCE_DEFAULT} before including @file{gpgme.h} to
change this default.

This function can be used in callback functions to construct an error
value to return it to the library.
@end deftypefun

The @code{libgpg-error} library provides error codes for all system
error numbers it knows about.  If @var{err} is an unknown error
number, the error code @code{GPG_ERR_UNKNOWN_ERRNO} is used.  The
following functions can be used to construct error values from system
errnor numbers.

@deftypefun {gpgme_error_t} gpgme_err_make_from_errno (@w{gpgme_err_source_t @var{source}}, @w{int @var{err}})
The function @code{gpgme_err_make_from_errno} is like
@code{gpgme_err_make}, but it takes a system error like @code{errno}
instead of a @code{gpgme_err_code_t} error code.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {gpgme_error_t} gpgme_error_from_errno (@w{int @var{err}})
The function @code{gpgme_error_from_errno} is like @code{gpgme_error},
but it takes a system error like @code{errno} instead of a
@code{gpgme_err_code_t} error code.
@end deftypefun

Sometimes you might want to map system error numbers to error codes
directly, or map an error code representing a system error back to the
system error number.  The following functions can be used to do that.

@deftypefun {gpgme_err_code_t} gpgme_err_code_from_errno (@w{int @var{err}})
The function @code{gpgme_err_code_from_errno} returns the error code
for the system error @var{err}.  If @var{err} is not a known system
error, the function returns @code{GPG_ERR_UNKNOWN_ERRNO}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun {int} gpgme_err_code_to_errno (@w{gpgme_err_code_t @var{err}})
The function @code{gpgme_err_code_to_errno} returns the system error
for the error code @var{err}.  If @var{err} is not an error code
representing a system error, or if this system error is not defined on
this system, the function returns @code{0}.
@end deftypefun


@node Error Sources
@section Error Sources
@cindex error codes, list of

The library @code{libgpg-error} defines an error source for every
component of the GnuPG system.  The error source part of an error
value is not well defined.  As such it is mainly useful to improve the
diagnostic error message for the user.

If the error code part of an error value is @code{0}, the whole error
value will be @code{0}.  In this case the error source part is of
course @code{GPG_ERR_SOURCE_UNKNOWN}.

The list of error sources that might occur in applications using
@acronym{GPGME} is:

@table @code
@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_UNKNOWN
The error source is not known.  The value of this error source is
@code{0}.

@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_GPGME
The error source is @acronym{GPGME} itself.  This is the default for
errors that occur in the @acronym{GPGME} library.

@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_GPG
The error source is GnuPG, which is the crypto engine used for the
OpenPGP protocol.

@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_GPGSM
The error source is GPGSM, which is the crypto engine used for the
CMS protocol.

@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_GCRYPT
The error source is @code{libgcrypt}, which is used by crypto engines
to perform cryptographic operations.

@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_GPGAGENT
The error source is @command{gpg-agent}, which is used by crypto
engines to perform operations with the secret key.

@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_PINENTRY
The error source is @command{pinentry}, which is used by
@command{gpg-agent} to query the passphrase to unlock a secret key.

@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_SCD
The error source is the SmartCard Daemon, which is used by
@command{gpg-agent} to delegate operations with the secret key to a
SmartCard.

@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_KEYBOX
The error source is @code{libkbx}, a library used by the crypto
engines to manage local keyrings.

@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_USER_1
@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_USER_2
@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_USER_3
@item GPG_ERR_SOURCE_USER_4
These error sources are not used by any GnuPG component and can be
used by other software.  For example, applications using
@acronym{GPGME} can use them to mark error values coming from callback
handlers.  Thus @code{GPG_ERR_SOURCE_USER_1} is the default for errors
created with @code{gpgme_error} and @code{gpgme_error_from_errno},
unless you define @code{GPGME_ERR_SOURCE_DEFAULT} before including
@file{gpgme.h}.
@end table


@node Error Codes
@section Error Codes
@cindex error codes, list of

The library @code{libgpg-error} defines many error values.  Most of
them are not used by @code{GPGME} directly, but might be returned by
@acronym{GPGME} because it received them from the crypto engine.  The
below list only includes such error codes that have a specific meaning
in @code{GPGME}, or which are so common that you should know about
them.

@table @code
@item GPG_ERR_EOF
This value indicates the end of a list, buffer or file.

@item GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR
This value indicates success.  The value of this error code is
@code{0}.  Also, it is guaranteed that an error value made from the
error code @code{0} will be @code{0} itself (as a whole).  This means
that the error source information is lost for this error code,
however, as this error code indicates that no error occurred, this is
generally not a problem.

@item GPG_ERR_GENERAL
This value means that something went wrong, but either there is not
enough information about the problem to return a more useful error
value, or there is no separate error value for this type of problem.

@item GPG_ERR_ENOMEM
This value means that an out-of-memory condition occurred.

@item GPG_ERR_E...
System errors are mapped to GPG_ERR_FOO where FOO is the symbol for
the system error.

@item GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE
This value means that some user provided data was out of range.  This
can also refer to objects.  For example, if an empty
@code{gpgme_data_t} object was expected, but one containing data was
provided, this error value is returned.

@item GPG_ERR_UNUSABLE_PUBKEY
This value means that some recipients for a message were invalid.

@item GPG_ERR_UNUSABLE_SECKEY
This value means that some signers were invalid.

@item GPG_ERR_NO_DATA
This value means that a @code{gpgme_data_t} object which was expected
to have content was found empty.

@item GPG_ERR_CONFLICT
This value means that a conflict of some sort occurred.

@item GPG_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED
This value indicates that the specific function (or operation) is not
implemented.  This error should never happen.  It can only occur if
you use certain values or configuration options which do not work,
but for which we think that they should work at some later time.

@item GPG_ERR_DECRYPT_FAILED
This value indicates that a decryption operation was unsuccessful.

@item GPG_ERR_BAD_PASSPHRASE
This value means that the user did not provide a correct passphrase
when requested.

@item GPG_ERR_CANCELED
This value means that the operation was canceled.

@item GPG_ERR_FULLY_CANCELED
This value means that the operation was canceled. It is sometimes returned
instead of @code{GPG_ERR_CANCELED} for internal reasons in GnuPG. You should
treat both values identically.

@item GPG_ERR_INV_ENGINE
This value means that the engine that implements the desired protocol
is currently not available.  This can either be because the sources
were configured to exclude support for this engine, or because the
engine is not installed properly.

@item GPG_ERR_AMBIGUOUS_NAME
This value indicates that a user ID or other specifier did not specify
a unique key.

@item GPG_ERR_WRONG_KEY_USAGE
This value indicates that a key is not used appropriately.

@item GPG_ERR_CERT_REVOKED
This value indicates that a key signature was revoced.

@item GPG_ERR_CERT_EXPIRED
This value indicates that a key signature expired.

@item GPG_ERR_NO_CRL_KNOWN
This value indicates that no certificate revocation list is known for
the certificate.

@item GPG_ERR_NO_POLICY_MATCH
This value indicates that a policy issue occurred.

@item GPG_ERR_NO_SECKEY
This value indicates that no secret key for the user ID is available.

@item GPG_ERR_MISSING_CERT
This value indicates that a key could not be imported because the
issuer certificate is missing.

@item GPG_ERR_BAD_CERT_CHAIN
This value indicates that a key could not be imported because its
certificate chain is not good, for example it could be too long.

@item GPG_ERR_UNSUPPORTED_ALGORITHM
This value means a verification failed because the cryptographic
algorithm is not supported by the crypto backend.

@item GPG_ERR_BAD_SIGNATURE
This value means a verification failed because the signature is bad.

@item GPG_ERR_NO_PUBKEY
This value means a verification failed because the public key is not
available.

@item GPG_ERR_USER_1
@item GPG_ERR_USER_2
@item ...
@item GPG_ERR_USER_16
These error codes are not used by any GnuPG component and can be
freely used by other software.  Applications using @acronym{GPGME}
might use them to mark specific errors returned by callback handlers
if no suitable error codes (including the system errors) for
these errors exist already.

@deftypefun {const char *} gpgme_strerror (@w{gpgme_error_t @var{err}})
The function @code{gpgme_strerror} returns a pointer to a statically
allocated string containing a description of the error code contained
in the error value @var{err}.  This string can be used to output a
diagnostic message to the user.

This function is not thread safe.  Use @code{gpgme_strerror_r} in
multi-threaded programs.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun {int} gpgme_strerror_r (@w{gpgme_error_t @var{err}}, @w{char *@var{buf}}, @w{size_t @var{buflen}})
The function @code{gpgme_strerror_r} returns the error string for
@var{err} in the user-supplied buffer @var{buf} of size @var{buflen}.
This function is, in contrast to @code{gpgme_strerror}, thread-safe if
a thread-safe @code{strerror_r} function is provided by the system.
If the function succeeds, 0 is returned and @var{buf} contains the
string describing the error.  If the buffer was not large enough,
ERANGE is returned and @var{buf} contains as much of the beginning of
the error string as fits into the buffer.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun {const char *} gpgme_strsource (@w{gpgme_error_t @var{err}})
The function @code{gpgme_strerror} returns a pointer to a statically

contained in the error value @var{err}.  This string can be used to
output a diagnostic message to the user.
@end deftypefun

The following example illustrates the use of @code{gpgme_strerror}:

@example

@node Exchanging Data
@chapter Exchanging Data
@cindex data, exchanging

A lot of data has to be exchanged between the user and the crypto
engine, like plaintext messages, ciphertext, signatures and
information about the keys.  The technical details about exchanging
the data information are completely abstracted by @acronym{GPGME}.
The user provides and receives the data via @code{gpgme_data_t} objects,
regardless of the communication protocol between @acronym{GPGME} and
the crypto engine in use.

@deftp {Data type} {gpgme_data_t}
The @code{gpgme_data_t} type is a handle for a container for generic
data, which is used by @acronym{GPGME} to exchange data with the user.
@end deftp

@code{gpgme_data_t} objects do not provide notifications on events.
It is assumed that read and write operations are blocking until data
is available.  If this is undesirable, the application must ensure
that all GPGME data operations always have data available, for example
by using memory buffers or files rather than pipes or sockets.  This
might be relevant, for example, if the external event loop mechanism
is used.

@deftp {Data type} {gpgme_off_t}
@since{1.4.1}

On POSIX platforms the @code{gpgme_off_t} type is an alias for
@code{off_t}; it may be used interchangeable.  On Windows platforms
@code{gpgme_off_t} is defined as a long (i.e. 32 bit) for 32 bit
Windows and as a 64 bit signed integer for 64 bit Windows.
@end deftp

@deftp {Data type} {gpgme_ssize_t}
The @code{gpgme_ssize_t} type is an alias for @code{ssize_t}.  It has
only been introduced to overcome portability problems pertaining to
the declaration of @code{ssize_t} by different toolchains.

@node Memory Based Data Buffers
@subsection Memory Based Data Buffers

Memory based data objects store all data in allocated memory.  This is
convenient, but only practical for an amount of data that is a
fraction of the available physical memory.  The data has to be copied
from its source and to its destination, which can often be avoided by
using one of the other data object

@deftypefun gpgme_error_t gpgme_data_new (@w{gpgme_data_t *@var{dh}})
The function @code{gpgme_data_new} creates a new @code{gpgme_data_t}
object and returns a handle for it in @var{dh}.  The data object is
memory based and initially empty.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the
data object was successfully created, @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if
@var{dh} is not a valid pointer, and @code{GPG_ERR_ENOMEM} if not
enough memory is available.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun gpgme_error_t gpgme_data_new_from_mem (@w{gpgme_data_t *@var{dh}}, @w{const char *@var{buffer}}, @w{size_t @var{size}}, @w{int @var{copy}})
The function @code{gpgme_data_new_from_mem} creates a new
@code{gpgme_data_t} object and fills it with @var{size} bytes starting
from @var{buffer}.

If @var{copy} is not zero, a private copy of the data is made.  If
@var{copy} is zero, the data is taken from the specified buffer as
needed, and the user has to ensure that the buffer remains valid for
the whole life span of the data object.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the
data object was successfully created, @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if
@var{dh} or @var{buffer} is not a valid pointer, and
@code{GPG_ERR_ENOMEM} if not enough memory is available.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun gpgme_error_t gpgme_data_new_from_file (@w{gpgme_data_t *@var{dh}}, @w{const char *@var{filename}}, @w{int @var{copy}})
The function @code{gpgme_data_new_from_file} creates a new
@code{gpgme_data_t} object and fills it with the content of the file
@var{filename}.

If @var{copy} is not zero, the whole file is read in at initialization
time and the file is not used anymore after that.  This is the only
mode supported currently.  Later, a value of zero for @var{copy} might
cause all reads to be delayed until the data is needed, but this is
not yet implemented.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the
data object was successfully created, @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if
@var{dh} or @var{filename} is not a valid pointer,
@code{GPG_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED} if @var{code} is zero, and
@code{GPG_ERR_ENOMEM} if not enough memory is available.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun gpgme_error_t gpgme_data_new_from_filepart (@w{gpgme_data_t *@var{dh}}, @w{const char *@var{filename}}, @w{FILE *@var{fp}}, @w{off_t @var{offset}}, @w{size_t @var{length}})
The function @code{gpgme_data_new_from_filepart} creates a new
@code{gpgme_data_t} object and fills it with a part of the file specified
by @var{filename} or @var{fp}.

Exactly one of @var{filename} and @var{fp} must be non-zero, the other
must be zero.  The argument that is not zero specifies the file from
which @var{length} bytes are read into the data object, starting from
@var{offset}.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the
data object was successfully created, @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if
@var{dh} and exactly one of @var{filename} and @var{fp} is not a valid
pointer, and @code{GPG_ERR_ENOMEM} if not enough memory is available.
@end deftypefun


@node File Based Data Buffers
@subsection File Based Data Buffers

File based data objects operate directly on file descriptors or
streams.  Only a small amount of data is stored in core at any time,
so the size of the data objects is not limited by @acronym{GPGME}.

@deftypefun gpgme_error_t gpgme_data_new_from_fd (@w{gpgme_data_t *@var{dh}}, @w{int @var{fd}})
The function @code{gpgme_data_new_from_fd} creates a new
@code{gpgme_data_t} object and uses the file descriptor @var{fd} to read
from (if used as an input data object) and write to (if used as an
output data object).

When using the data object as an input buffer, the function might read
a bit more from the file descriptor than is actually needed by the
crypto engine in the desired operation because of internal buffering.

Note that GPGME assumes that the file descriptor is set to blocking
mode.  Errors during I/O operations, except for EINTR, are usually
fatal for crypto operations.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the
data object was successfully created, and @code{GPG_ERR_ENOMEM} if not
enough memory is available.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun gpgme_error_t gpgme_data_new_from_stream (@w{gpgme_data_t *@var{dh}}, @w{FILE *@var{stream}})
The function @code{gpgme_data_new_from_stream} creates a new
@code{gpgme_data_t} object and uses the I/O stream @var{stream} to read
from (if used as an input data object) and write to (if used as an
output data object).

When using the data object as an input buffer, the function might read
a bit more from the stream than is actually needed by the crypto
engine in the desired operation because of internal buffering.

Note that GPGME assumes that the stream is in blocking mode.  Errors
during I/O operations, except for EINTR, are usually fatal for crypto
operations.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the
data object was successfully created, and @code{GPG_ERR_ENOMEM} if not
enough memory is available.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun gpgme_error_t gpgme_data_new_from_estream (@w{gpgme_data_t *@var{dh}}, @w{gpgrt_stream_t @var{stream}})
The function @code{gpgme_data_new_from_estream} creates a new
@code{gpgme_data_t} object and uses the gpgrt stream @var{stream} to read
from (if used as an input data object) and write to (if used as an
output data object).

When using the data object as an input buffer, the function might read
a bit more from the stream than is actually needed by the crypto
engine in the desired operation because of internal buffering.

Note that GPGME assumes that the stream is in blocking mode.  Errors
during I/O operations, except for EINTR, are usually fatal for crypto
operations.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the
data object was successfully created, and @code{GPG_ERR_ENOMEM} if not
enough memory is available.
@end deftypefun


@node Callback Based Data Buffers
@subsection Callback Based Data Buffers

If neither memory nor file based data objects are a good fit for your
application, you can implement the functions a data object provides
yourself and create a data object from these callback functions.

@deftp {Data type} {ssize_t (*gpgme_data_read_cb_t) (@w{void *@var{handle}}, @w{void @var{*buffer}}, @w{size_t @var{size}})}
@tindex gpgme_data_read_cb_t
The @code{gpgme_data_read_cb_t} type is the type of functions which
@acronym{GPGME} calls if it wants to read data from a user-implemented
data object.  The function should read up to @var{size} bytes from the
current read position into the space starting at @var{buffer}.  The
@var{handle} is provided by the user at data object creation time.

Note that GPGME assumes that the read blocks until data is available.
Errors during I/O operations, except for EINTR, are usually fatal for
crypto operations.

The function should return the number of bytes read, 0 on EOF, and -1
on error.  If an error occurs, @var{errno} should be set to describe
the type of the error.
@end deftp

@deftp {Data type} {ssize_t (*gpgme_data_write_cb_t) (@w{void *@var{handle}}, @w{const void @var{*buffer}}, @w{size_t @var{size}})}

Note that GPGME assumes that the write blocks until data is available.
Errors during I/O operations, except for EINTR, are usually fatal for

The function @code{gpgme_data_release_and_get_mem} is like
@code{gpgme_data_release}, except that it returns the data buffer and
its length that was provided by the object.

The user has to release the buffer with @code{gpgme_free}.  In case
the user provided the data buffer in non-copy mode, a copy will be
made for this purpose.

In case an error returns, or there is no suitable data buffer that can
be returned to the user, the function will return @code{NULL}.  In any

@deftypefun ssize_t gpgme_data_read (@w{gpgme_data_t @var{dh}}, @w{void *@var{buffer}}, @w{size_t @var{length}})
The function @code{gpgme_data_read} reads up to @var{length} bytes
from the data object with the handle @var{dh} into the space starting
at @var{buffer}.

If no error occurs, the actual amount read is returned.  If the end of
the data object is reached, the function returns 0.

In all other cases, the function returns -1 and sets @var{errno}.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun ssize_t gpgme_data_write (@w{gpgme_data_t @var{dh}}, @w{const void *@var{buffer}}, @w{size_t @var{size}})
The function @code{gpgme_data_write} writes up to @var{size} bytes
starting from @var{buffer} into the data object with the handle
@var{dh} at the current write position.

The function returns the number of bytes actually written, or -1 if an
error occurs.  If an error occurs, @var{errno} is set.
@end deftypefun

@deftypefun off_t gpgme_data_seek (@w{gpgme_data_t @var{dh}}, @w{off_t @var{offset}}, @w{int @var{whence}})
The function @code{gpgme_data_seek} changes the current read/write
position.

The @var{whence} argument specifies how the @var{offset} should be
interpreted.  It must be one of the following symbolic constants:

@table @code
@item SEEK_SET
Specifies that @var{offset} is a count of characters from the
beginning of the data object.

@item SEEK_CUR
Specifies that @var{offset} is a count of characters from the current
file position.  This count may be positive or negative.

@item SEEK_END
Specifies that @var{offset} is a count of characters from the end of
the data object.  A negative count specifies a position within the
current extent of the data object; a positive count specifies a
position past the current end.  If you set the position past the
current end, and actually write data, you will extend the data object
with zeros up to that position.
@end table

If successful, the function returns the resulting file position,
measured in bytes from the beginning of the data object.  You can use
this feature together with @code{SEEK_CUR} to read the current
read/write position.

If the function fails, -1 is returned and @var{errno} is set.

string containing the file name associated with the data object.  The
file name will be stored in the output when encrypting or signing the
data and will be returned to the user when decrypting or verifying the
output data.

If no error occurs, the string containing the file name is returned.
Otherwise, @code{NULL} will be returned.

The function @code{gpgme_data_set_file_name} sets the file name
associated with the data object.  The file name will be stored in the
output when encrypting or signing the data and will be returned to the
user when decrypting or verifying the output data.

If a signed or encrypted archive is created, then the file name will be
interpreted as the base directory for the relative paths of the files and
directories to put into the archive.  This corresponds to the --directory
option of gpgtar.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if

@table @code
@item size-hint
The value is a decimal number with the length gpgme shall assume for
this data object.  This is useful if the data is provided by callbacks
or via file descriptors but the applications knows the total size of
the data.  If this is set the OpenPGP engine may use this to decide on
buffer allocation strategies and to provide a total value for its
progress information.

@item io-buffer-size
The value is a decimal number with the length of internal buffers to
used for internal I/O operations.  The value is capped at 1048576 (1
MiB).  In certain environments large buffers can yield a performance
boost for callback bases data object, but the details depend a lot on
the circumstances and the operating system.  This flag may only be set
once and must be set before any actual I/O happens ion the data
objects.

@item sensitive
If the numeric value is not 0 the data object is considered to contain
sensitive information like passwords or key material.  If this is set
the internal buffers are securely overwritten with zeroes by
gpgme_data_release.

external services (e.g. CRL / OCSP checks).  The offline mode is used
for all operations on this context.  It has only an effect with
GnuPG versions 2.1.6 or later.

For the OpenPGP protocol offline mode entirely disables the use of the
Dirmngr and will thus guarantee that no network connections are done
as part of an operation on this context.  It has only an effect with
GnuPG versions 2.1.23 or later.

For all other protocols the offline mode is currently ignored.

Return a Pinentry error @code{No Pinentry}.

@item GPGME_PINENTRY_MODE_LOOPBACK

Redirect Pinentry queries to the caller.
This enables the use of @code{gpgme_set_passphrase_cb} because pinentry
queries are redirected to gpgme.

Note: For 2.1.0 - 2.1.12 this mode requires @code{allow-loopback-pinentry}

@cindex key listing, mode of

@deftypefun gpgme_error_t gpgme_set_keylist_mode (@w{gpgme_ctx_t @var{ctx}}, @w{gpgme_keylist_mode_t @var{mode}})
The function @code{gpgme_set_keylist_mode} changes the default
behaviour of the key listing functions.  The value in @var{mode} is a
bitwise-or combination of one or multiple of the following bit values:

@table @code
@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCAL
The @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCAL} symbol specifies that the local
keyring should be searched for keys in the keylisting operation.  This
is the default.

Using only this option results in a @code{--list-keys}.

@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN
The @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN} symbol specifies that an external
source should be searched for keys in the keylisting operation.  The
type of external source is dependent on the crypto engine used and
whether it is combined with @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCAL}.  For
example, it can be a remote keyserver or LDAP certificate server.

Using only this option results in a @code{--search-keys} for
@code{GPGME_PROTOCOL_OpenPGP} and something similar to
@code{--list-external-keys} for @code{GPGME_PROTOCOL_CMS}.

@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCATE
This is a shortcut for the combination of
@code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCAL} and @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN}, which
results in a @code{--locate-keys} for @code{GPGME_PROTOCOL_OpenPGP}.

@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_SIGS
The @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_SIGS} symbol specifies that the key
signatures should be included in the listed keys.

@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_SIG_NOTATIONS
@since{1.1.1}

The @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_SIG_NOTATIONS} symbol specifies that the
signature notations on key signatures should be included in the listed
keys.  This only works if @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_SIGS} is also
enabled.

@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_WITH_TOFU
@since{1.7.0}

The @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_WITH_TOFU} symbol specifies that
information pertaining to the TOFU trust model should be included in
the listed keys.

@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_WITH_KEYGRIP
@since{1.14.0}

The @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_WITH_KEYRIP} symbol specifies that the
keygrip is always included in the listing.  The default depends on the
version of the backend and the used protocol.

@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_WITH_SECRET
@since{1.5.1}

The @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_WITH_SECRET} returns information about
the presence of a corresponding secret key in a public key listing.  A
public key listing with this mode is slower than a standard listing
but can be used instead of a second run to list the secret keys.  This
is only supported for GnuPG versions >= 2.1.  Note that using this
option also makes sure that the keygrip is available in the output.

@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EPHEMERAL
@since{1.2.0}

The @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EPHEMERAL} symbol specifies that keys
flagged as ephemeral are included in the listing.

@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_WITH_V5FPR
@since{1.23.0}

The @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_WITH_V5FPR} symbol specifies that key
listings shall also provide v5 style fingerprints for v4 OpenPGp keys.

@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_VALIDATE
@since{0.4.5}

The @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_VALIDATE} symbol specifies that the
backend should do key or certificate validation and not just get the
validity information from an internal cache.  This might be an
expensive operation and is in general not useful.  Currently only
implemented for the S/MIME backend and ignored for other backends.

@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_FORCE_EXTERN
@since{1.18.0}

The @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_FORCE_EXTERN} symbol specifies that only
external sources should be searched for keys in the keylisting
operation.  If used in combination with @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCATE},
the keylisting results in a @code{--locate-external-keys} for
@code{GPGME_PROTOCOL_OpenPGP}.  The combination with
@code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCAL}, but without @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN}
is not allowed.  Currently only implemented for the OpenPGP backend and
ignored for other backends.

@item GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCATE_EXTERNAL
@since{1.18.0}

This is a shortcut for the combination of
@code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCATE} and @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_FORCE_EXTERN},
which results in a @code{--locate-external-keys} for
@code{GPGME_PROTOCOL_OpenPGP}.

@end table

At least one of @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCAL} and
@code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN} must be specified.  For future binary
compatibility, you should get the current mode with
@code{gpgme_get_keylist_mode} and modify it by setting or clearing the
appropriate bits, and then using that calculated value in the
@code{gpgme_set_keylisting_mode} operation.  This will leave all other
bits in the mode value intact (in particular those that are not used
in the current version of the library).

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the
mode could be set correctly, and @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if @var{ctx}
is not a valid pointer or @var{mode} is not a valid mode.
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun gpgme_keylist_mode_t gpgme_get_keylist_mode (@w{gpgme_ctx_t @var{ctx}})
The function @code{gpgme_get_keylist_mode} returns the current key
listing mode of the context @var{ctx}.  This value can then be
modified and used in a subsequent @code{gpgme_set_keylist_mode}
operation to only affect the desired bits (and leave all others
intact).

The function returns 0 if @var{ctx} is not a valid pointer, and the
current mode otherwise.  Note that 0 is not a valid mode value.

@tindex gpgme_passphrase_cb_t
The @code{gpgme_passphrase_cb_t} type is the type of functions usable as
passphrase callback function.

The argument @var{uid_hint} might contain a string that gives an
indication for which user ID the passphrase is required.  If this is
not available, or not applicable (in the case of symmetric encryption,
for example), @var{uid_hint} will be @code{NULL}.

The argument @var{passphrase_info}, if not @code{NULL}, will give
further information about the context in which the passphrase is
required.  This information is engine and operation specific.

If this is the repeated attempt to get the passphrase, because
previous attempts failed, then @var{prev_was_bad} is 1, otherwise it
will be 0.

The user must write the passphrase, followed by a newline character,
to the file descriptor @var{fd}.  The function @code{gpgme_io_writen}
should be used for the write operation.  Note that if the user returns
0 to indicate success, the user must at least write a newline
character before returning from the callback.

If an error occurs, return the corresponding @code{gpgme_error_t}
value.  You can use the error code @code{GPG_ERR_CANCELED} to abort
the operation.  Otherwise, return @code{0}.

Note: The passphrase_cb only works with GnuPG 1.x and 2.1.x and not
with the 2.0.x series. See @code{gpgme_set_pinentry_mode} for more
details on 2.1.x usage.
@end deftp

@deftypefun void gpgme_set_passphrase_cb (@w{gpgme_ctx_t @var{ctx}}, @w{gpgme_passphrase_cb_t @var{passfunc}}, @w{void *@var{hook_value}})
The function @code{gpgme_set_passphrase_cb} sets the function that is
used when a passphrase needs to be provided by the user to
@var{passfunc}.  The function @var{passfunc} needs to implemented by
the user, and whenever it is called, it is called with its first
argument being @var{hook_value}.  By default, no passphrase callback
function is set.

Not all crypto engines require this callback to retrieve the
passphrase.  It is better if the engine retrieves the passphrase from
a trusted agent (a daemon process), rather than having each user to
implement their own passphrase query.  Some engines do not even
support an external passphrase callback at all, in this case the error
code @code{GPG_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED} is returned.

For GnuPG >= 2.1 the pinentry mode has to be set to
@code{GPGME_PINENTRY_MODE_LOOPBACK} to enable the passphrase callback.
See @code{gpgme_set_pinentry_mode}.

The user can disable the use of a passphrase callback function by
calling @code{gpgme_set_passphrase_cb} with @var{passfunc} being
@code{NULL}.

is set.

Setting a callback function allows an interactive program to display
progress information about a long operation to the user.

@since{1.7.0}

Some minor properties of the context can be controlled with flags set
by this function.  The properties are identified by the following
values for @var{name}:

@table @code
@item "redraw"
This flag is normally not changed by the caller because GPGME sets and
clears it automatically: The flag is cleared before an operation and
set if an operation noticed that the engine has launched a Pinentry.
A Curses based application may use this information to redraw the
screen; for example:

@example
    err = gpgme_op_keylist_start (ctx, "foo@@example.org", 0);
    while (!err)
      @{
        err = gpgme_op_keylist_next (ctx, &key);
        if (err)
          break;
        show_key (key);
        gpgme_key_release (key);
      @}
    if ((s = gpgme_get_ctx_flag (ctx, "redraw")) && *s)
      redraw_screen ();
    gpgme_release (ctx);
@end example


@item "full-status"
Using a @var{value} of "1" the status callback set by
gpgme_set_status_cb returns all status lines with the exception of
PROGRESS lines.  With the default of "0" the status callback is only
called in certain situations.

@item "raw-description"
Setting the @var{value} to "1" returns human readable strings in a raw
format.  For example the non breaking space characters ("~") will not
be removed from the @code{description} field of the
@code{gpgme_tofu_info_t} object.

@item "export-session-key"
Using a @var{value} of "1" specifies that the context should try to
export the symmetric session key when decrypting data.  By default, or
when using an empty string or "0" for @var{value}, session keys are
not exported.

@item "override-session-key"
The string given in @var{value} is passed to the GnuPG engine to override
the session key for decryption.  The format of that session key is
specific to GnuPG and can be retrieved during a decrypt operation when
the context flag "export-session-key" is enabled.  Please be aware that
using this feature with GnuPG < 2.1.16 or when decrypting an archive
will leak the session key on many platforms via ps(1).

@item "auto-key-retrieve"
Setting the @var{value} to "1" asks the backend to automatically
retrieve a key for signature verification if possible.  Note that this
option makes a "web bug" like behavior possible.  Keyserver or Web Key
Directory operators can see which keys you request, so by sending you
a message signed by a brand new key (which you naturally will not have
on your local keyring), the operator can tell both your IP address and
the time when you verified the signature.

@item "auto-key-import"
Setting the @var{value} to "1" forces the GPG backend to automatically
import a missing key for signature verification from the signature.

@item "include-key-block"
Setting the @var{value} to "1" forces the GPG backend to embed the
signing key as well as an encryption subkey into the the signature.

@item "request-origin"
The string given in @var{value} is passed to the GnuPG engines to
request restrictions based on the origin of the request.  Valid values
are documented in the GnuPG manual and the gpg man page under the
option @option{--request-origin}.  Requires at least GnuPG 2.2.6 to have an
effect.

@item "no-symkey-cache"
For OpenPGP disable the passphrase cache used for symmetrical en- and
decryption.  This cache is based on the message specific salt value.
Requires at least GnuPG 2.2.7 to have an effect.

@item "ignore-mdc-error"
This flag passes the option @option{--ignore-mdc-error} to gpg.  This
can be used to force decryption of a message which failed due to a
missing integrity check.  This flag must be used with great caution
and only if it is a known non-corrupted old message and the decryption
result of the former try had the decryption result flag
@code{legacy_cipher_nomdc} set.  For failsafe reasons this flag is
reset after each operation.

@item "auto-key-locate"
The string given in @var{value} is passed to gpg.  This can be used
to change the behavior of a @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_LOCATE} keylisting.
Valid values are documented in the GnuPG manual and the gpg man page under
the option @option{--auto-key-locate}.
Requires at least GnuPG 2.1.18.

Note: Keys retrieved through @code{auto-key-locate} are automatically
imported in the keyring.

@item trust-model
@since{1.11.2}

Change the trust-model for all GnuPG engine operations.  An empty
string sets the trust-model back to the users default.  If the
trust-model is not supported by GnuPG the behavior is undefined
and will likely cause all operations to fail.  Example: "tofu+pgp".

This options should be used carefully with a strict version
requirement.  In some versions of GnuPG setting the
trust-model changes the default trust-model for future operations.
A change in the trust-model also can have unintended side effects, like
rebuilding the trust-db.

@item "extended-edit"
This flag passes the option @option{--expert} to gpg key edit.  This
can be used to get additional callbacks in @code{gpgme_op_edit}.

@item "cert-expire"
@since{1.15.2}
The string given in @var{value} is passed to the GnuPG engine to set
the expiration time to use for key signature expiration.  Valid values
are documented in the GnuPG manual and the gpg man page under
the option @option{--default-cert-expire}.

@item "key-origin"
@since{1.16.1}
The string given in @var{value} is passed to the GnuPG engine to set
the origin of imported keys.  Valid values are documented in the GnuPG
manual and the gpg man page under the option @option{--key-origin}.

@item "import-filter"
@since{1.16.1}
The string given in @var{value} is passed to the GnuPG engine to use as
filter when importing keys.  Valid values are documented in the GnuPG
manual and the gpg man page under the option @option{--import-filter}.

@item "no-auto-check-trustdb"
@since{1.19.0}
Setting the @var{value} to "1" forces the GPG backend to disable the
automatic check of the trust database.

@node Locale
@subsection Locale
@cindex locale, default
@cindex locale, of a context

A locale setting can be associated with a context.  This locale is
passed to the crypto engine, and used for applications like the PIN
entry, which is displayed to the user when entering a passphrase is
required.

The default locale is used to initialize the locale setting of all
contexts created afterwards.

@deftypefun gpgme_error_t gpgme_set_locale (@w{gpgme_ctx_t @var{ctx}}, @w{int @var{category}}, @w{const char *@var{value}})
@since{0.4.3}

The function @code{gpgme_set_locale} sets the locale of the context
@var{ctx}, or the default locale if @var{ctx} is a null pointer.

The locale settings that should be changed are specified by
@var{category}.  Supported categories are @code{LC_CTYPE},
@code{LC_MESSAGES}, and @code{LC_ALL}, which is a wildcard you can use
if you want to change all the categories at once.

The value to be used for the locale setting is @var{value}, which will
be copied to @acronym{GPGME}'s internal data structures.  @var{value}
can be a null pointer, which disables setting the locale, and will
make PIN entry and other applications use their default setting, which
is usually not what you want.

Note that the settings are only used if the application runs on a text
terminal, and that the settings should fit the configuration of the
output terminal.  Normally, it is sufficient to initialize the default
value at startup.

The function returns an error if not enough memory is available.

The function @code{gpgme_op_getauditlog} is used to obtain additional
logs as specified by @var{flags} into the @var{output} data.  If

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if a
log could be queried from the engine, and @code{GPG_ERR_NOT_IMPLEMENTED}
if the log specified in @var{flags} is not available for this engine.
If no log is available @code{GPG_ERR_NO_DATA} is returned.

The value in @var{flags} is a bitwise-or combination of one or
multiple of the following bit values:

@table @code
@item GPGME_AUDITLOG_DIAG
@since{1.11.2}

Obtain diagnostic output which would be written to @code{stderr} in
interactive use of the engine.  This can be used to provide additional
diagnostic information in case of errors in other operations.

Note: If log-file has been set in the configuration the log will
be empty and @code{GPG_ERR_NO_DATA} will be returned.

Implemented for: @code{GPGME_PROTOCOL_OpenPGP}

@item GPGME_AUDITLOG_DEFAULT
@since{1.11.2}

This flag has the value 0 for compatibility reasons.  Obtains additional
information from the engine by issuing the @code{GETAUDITLOG} command.

@deftp {Data type} gpgme_key_sig_t

The @code{gpgme_key_sig_t} type is a pointer to a key signature structure.
Key signatures are one component of a @code{gpgme_key_t} object, and
validate user IDs on the key in the OpenPGP protocol.

The signatures on a key are only available if the key was retrieved
via a listing operation with the @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_SIGS} mode
enabled, because it can be expensive to retrieve all signatures of a
key.

The signature notations on a key signature are only available if the
key was retrieved via a listing operation with the
@code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_SIG_NOTATIONS} mode enabled, because it can
be expensive to retrieve all signature notations.

The key signature structure has the following members:

@table @code

@deftypefun gpgme_error_t gpgme_op_keylist_start (@w{gpgme_ctx_t @var{ctx}}, @w{const char *@var{pattern}}, @w{int @var{secret_only}})

The function @code{gpgme_op_keylist_start} initiates a key listing
operation inside the context @var{ctx}.  It sets everything up so that
subsequent invocations of @code{gpgme_op_keylist_next} return the keys
in the list.

If @var{pattern} is @code{NULL}, all available keys are returned.
Otherwise, @var{pattern} contains an engine specific expression that
is used to limit the list to all keys matching the pattern.  Note that
the total length of the pattern is restricted to an engine-specific
maximum (a couple of hundred characters are usually accepted).  The
pattern should be used to restrict the search to a certain common name
or user, not to list many specific keys at once by listing their
fingerprints or key IDs.

If @var{secret_only} is not @code{0}, the list is restricted to secret
keys only.

The context will be busy until either all keys are received (and
@code{gpgme_op_keylist_next} returns @code{GPG_ERR_EOF}), or
@code{gpgme_op_keylist_end} is called to finish the operation.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if

The function @code{gpgme_op_keylist_ext_start} initiates an extended
key listing operation inside the context @var{ctx}.  It sets
everything up so that subsequent invocations of
@code{gpgme_op_keylist_next} return the keys in the list.

If @var{pattern} or @var{*pattern} is @code{NULL}, all available keys
are returned.  Otherwise, @var{pattern} is a @code{NULL} terminated
array of strings that are used to limit the list to all keys matching
at least one of the patterns verbatim.  Note that the total length of
all patterns is restricted to an engine-specific maximum (the exact
limit also depends on the number of patterns and amount of quoting
required, but a couple of hundred characters are usually accepted).
Patterns should be used to restrict the search to a certain common

@since{1.8.0}

The function @code{gpgme_op_keylist_from_data_start} initiates a key

so that subsequent invocations of @code{gpgme_op_keylist_next} return
the keys from @var{data}.

The value of @var{reserved} must be @code{0}.

This function requires at least GnuPG version 2.1.14 and currently
works only with OpenPGP keys.

The context will be busy until either all keys are received (and
@code{gpgme_op_keylist_next} returns @code{GPG_ERR_EOF}), or

After the operation completed successfully, the result of the key
listing operation can be retrieved with
@code{gpgme_op_keylist_result}.

@deftp {Data type} {gpgme_keylist_result_t}
This is a pointer to a structure used to store the result of a
@code{gpgme_op_keylist_*} operation.  After successfully ending a key
listing operation, you can retrieve the pointer to the result with
@code{gpgme_op_keylist_result}.  The structure contains the following

This is true if the crypto backend had to truncate the result, and
less than the desired keys could be listed.
@end table
@end deftp

@deftypefun gpgme_keylist_result_t gpgme_op_keylist_result (@w{gpgme_ctx_t @var{ctx}})
The function @code{gpgme_op_keylist_result} returns a
@code{gpgme_keylist_result_t} pointer to a structure holding the
result of a @code{gpgme_op_keylist_*} operation.  The pointer is only
valid if the last operation on the context was a key listing
operation, and if this operation finished successfully.  The returned
pointer is only valid until the next operation is started on the
context.
@end deftypefun

In a simple program, for which a blocking operation is acceptable, the
following function can be used to retrieve a single key.

@deftypefun gpgme_error_t gpgme_get_key (@w{gpgme_ctx_t @var{ctx}}, @w{const char *@var{fpr}}, @w{gpgme_key_t *@var{r_key}}, @w{int @var{secret}})
The function @code{gpgme_get_key} gets the key with the fingerprint
(or key ID) @var{fpr} from the crypto backend and return it in
@var{r_key}.  If @var{secret} is true, get the secret key.  The
currently active keylist mode is used to retrieve the key.  The key
will have one reference for the user.

If the key is not found in the keyring, @code{gpgme_get_key} returns
the error code @code{GPG_ERR_EOF} and *@var{r_key} will be set to
@code{NULL}.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if
@var{ctx} or @var{r_key} is not a valid pointer or @var{fpr} is not a
fingerprint or key ID, @code{GPG_ERR_AMBIGUOUS_NAME} if the key ID was

The function @code{gpgme_op_setexpire} sets the expiration time of
the key @var{key} or of the specified subkeys.
This function requires at least version 2.1.22 of GnuPG.

@var{key} specifies the key to operate on.

@var{expires} specifies the expiration time in seconds from now.
To be similar to other usages where expiration times are provided
in unsigned long this is similar to the key creation date
and so it is in seconds from NOW.

The common case is to use 0 to not set an expiration time.
Note that this parameter takes an unsigned long value and not
a @code{time_t} to avoid problems on systems which use a signed
32 bit @code{time_t}.  Note further that the OpenPGP protocol
uses 32 bit values for timestamps and thus can
only encode dates up to the year 2106.

@var{subfprs} selects the subkey(s) for which the expiration time
should be set.  If @var{subfprs} is set to @code{NULL}, then the
expiration time of the primary key is set.  If @var{subfprs} is
an asterisk (@code{*}), then the expiration times of all non-revoked
and not yet expired subkeys are set.  To select more than one subkey
put all subkey fingerprints into one string separated by linefeeds
characters (@code{\n}).

@var{reserved} is reserved for later use and must be @code{0}.

GPGME provides a set of functions to create public key pairs.  Most of
these functions require the use of GnuPG 2.1 and later; for older
GnuPG versions the @code{gpgme_op_genkey} function can be used.
Existing code which wants to update to the new functions or new code
which shall supports older GnuPG versions may try the new functions
first and provide a fallback to the old function if the error code
@code{GPG_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED} is received.

       @w{gpgme_key_t @var{extrakey}}, @
       @w{unsigned int @var{flags}});

@since{1.7.0}

The function @code{gpgme_op_createkey} generates a new key for the
procotol active in the context @var{ctx}.  As of now this function
does only work for OpenPGP and requires at least version 2.1.13 of
GnuPG.

@var{userid} is commonly the mail address associated with the key.
GPGME does not require a specific syntax but if more than a mail
address is given, RFC-822 style format is suggested.  The value is
expected to be in UTF-8 encoding (i.e. no IDN encoding for mail
addresses).  This is a required parameter.

@var{algo} specifies the algorithm for the new key (actually a keypair
of public and private key).  For a list of supported algorithms, see
the GnuPG manual.  If @var{algo} is @code{NULL} or the string
"default", the key is generated using the default algorithm of the
engine.  If the string "future-default" is used the engine may use an
algorithm which is planned to be the default in a future release of
the engine; however existing implementation of the protocol may not be
able to already handle such future algorithms.  For the OpenPGP
protocol, the specification of a default algorithm, without requesting
a non-default usage via @var{flags}, triggers the creation of a
primary key plus a secondary key (subkey).

@var{reserved} must be set to zero.

@var{expires} specifies the expiration time in seconds.  If you supply
0, a reasonable expiration time is chosen.  Use the flag
@code{GPGME_CREATE_NOEXPIRE} to create keys that do not expire.  Note
that this parameter takes an unsigned long value and not a
@code{time_t} to avoid problems on systems which use a signed 32 bit
@code{time_t}.  Note further that the OpenPGP protocol uses 32 bit
values for timestamps and thus can only encode dates up to the year
2106.

@var{extrakey} is currently not used and must be set to @code{NULL}.
A future version of GPGME may use this parameter to create X.509 keys.

@var{flags} can be set to the bit-wise OR of the following flags:

@table @code
@item GPGME_CREATE_SIGN
@itemx GPGME_CREATE_ENCR
@itemx GPGME_CREATE_CERT
@itemx GPGME_CREATE_AUTH
@since{1.7.0}

Do not create the key with the default capabilities (key usage) of the
requested algorithm but use those explicitly given by these flags:
``signing'', ``encryption'', ``certification'', or ``authentication''.
The allowed combinations depend on the algorithm.

If any of these flags are set and a default algorithm has been
selected only one key is created in the case of the OpenPGP
protocol.

@item GPGME_CREATE_NOPASSWD
@since{1.7.0}

Request generation of the key without password protection.

@item GPGME_CREATE_SELFSIGNED
@since{1.7.0}

For an X.509 key do not create a CSR but a self-signed certificate.
This has not yet been implemented.

@item GPGME_CREATE_NOSTORE
@since{1.7.0}

Do not store the created key in the local key database.
This has not yet been implemented.

@item GPGME_CREATE_WANTPUB
@itemx GPGME_CREATE_WANTSEC
@since{1.7.0}

Return the public or secret key as part of the result structure.
This has not yet been implemented.

@item GPGME_CREATE_FORCE
@since{1.7.0}

The engine does not allow the creation of a key with a user ID
already existing in the local key database.  This flag can be used to
override this check.

@item GPGME_CREATE_NOEXPIRE
@since{1.9.0}

Request generation of keys that do not expire.

@end table

After the operation completed successfully, information about the
created key can be retrieved with @code{gpgme_op_genkey_result}.

The function returns zero on success, @code{GPG_ERR_NOT_SUPPORTED} if
the engine does not support the command, or a bunch of other error
codes.

Subkeys (aka secondary keys) are a concept in the OpenPGP protocol to
bind several keys to a primary key.  As of now this function requires

@var{key} specifies the key to operate on.

@var{userid} is the user ID to be revoked from the key.  The user ID

user IDs after key creation is a feature of the OpenPGP protocol and
thus the protocol for the context @var{ctx} must be set to OpenPGP.

@var{key} specifies the key to operate on.  This parameters is required.

@var{userid} is the user ID of the key to be manipulated.  This user ID

The function @code{gpgme_op_genkey} generates a new key pair in the
context @var{ctx}.  The meaning of @var{public} and @var{secret}
depends on the crypto backend.

GPG does not support @var{public} and @var{secret}, they should be
@code{NULL}.  GnuPG will generate a key pair and add it to the
standard key ring.  The fingerprint of the generated key is available
with @code{gpgme_op_genkey_result}.

GpgSM requires @var{public} to be a writable data object.  GpgSM will
generate a secret key (which will be stored by @command{gpg-agent},
and return a certificate request in @var{public}, which then needs to
be signed by the certification authority and imported before it can be
used.  GpgSM does not make the fingerprint available.

The argument @var{parms} specifies parameters for the key in an string
that looks something like XML.  The details about the format of
@var{parms} are specific to the crypto engine used by @var{ctx}.  The
first line of the parameters must be @code{<GnupgKeyParams
format="internal">} and the last line must be
@code{</GnupgKeyParams>}.  Every line in between the first and last
lines is treated as a Header: Value pair.  In particular, no XML
escaping is necessary if you need to include the characters @code{<},
@code{>}, or @code{&}.

Here is an example for GnuPG as the crypto engine (all parameters of
OpenPGP key generation are documented in the GPG manual):

@example
<GnupgKeyParms format="internal">
Key-Type: default
Subkey-Type: default
Name-Real: Joe Tester
Name-Comment: with stupid passphrase
Name-Email: joe@@foo.bar
Expire-Date: 0
Passphrase: abc
</GnupgKeyParms>
@end example

Here is an example for GpgSM as the crypto engine (all parameters of
OpenPGP key generation are documented in the GPGSM manual):

@example
<GnupgKeyParms format="internal">
Key-Type: RSA
Key-Length: 1024
Name-DN: C=de,O=g10 code,OU=Testlab,CN=Joe 2 Tester
Name-Email: joe@@foo.bar
</GnupgKeyParms>
@end example

Strings should be given in UTF-8 encoding.  The only format supported
for now is ``internal''.  The content of the @code{GnupgKeyParms}
container is passed verbatim to the crypto backend.  Control
statements are not allowed.

After the operation completed successfully, the result can be
retrieved with @code{gpgme_op_genkey_result}.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the
operation could be started successfully, @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if
@var{parms} is not a well-formed string (e.g. does not have the

@subsection Signing Keys
@cindex key, signing

Key signatures are a unique concept of the OpenPGP protocol.  They can
be used to certify the validity of a key and are used to create the
Web-of-Trust (WoT).  Instead of using the @code{gpgme_op_interact}
function along with a finite state machine, GPGME provides a
convenient function to create key signatures when using modern GnuPG
versions.

       @w{unsigned long @var{expires}}, @
       @w{unsigned int @var{flags}});

@since{1.7.0}

The function @code{gpgme_op_keysign} adds a new key signature to the
public key @var{KEY}.   This function requires at least version 2.1.12 of
GnuPG.

@var{CTX} is the usual context which describes the protocol to use
(which must be OpenPGP) and has also the list of signer keys to be
used for the signature.  The common case is to use the default key for
signing other keys.  If another key or more than one key shall be used
for a key signature, @code{gpgme_signers_add} can be used.
@xref{Selecting Signers}.

@var{key} specifies the key to operate on.

@var{userid} selects the user ID or user IDs to be signed.  If
@var{userid} is set to @code{NULL} all valid user IDs are signed.  The
user ID must be given verbatim because the engine does an exact and
case sensitive match.  Thus the @code{uid} field from the user ID
object (@code{gpgme_user_id_t}) is to be used.  To select more than
one user ID put them all into one string separated by linefeeds
characters (@code{\n}) and set the flag @code{GPGME_KEYSIGN_LFSEP}.

@var{expires} specifies the expiration time of the new signature in
seconds.  The common case is to use 0 to not set an expiration date.
However, if the configuration of the engine defines a default
expiration for key signatures, that is still used unless the flag
@code{GPGME_KEYSIGN_NOEXPIRE} is used.  Note that this parameter takes
an unsigned long value and not a @code{time_t} to avoid problems on
systems which use a signed 32 bit @code{time_t}.  Note further that
the OpenPGP protocol uses 32 bit values for timestamps and thus can
only encode dates up to the year 2106.

@var{flags} can be set to the bit-wise OR of the following flags:

@table @code
@item GPGME_KEYSIGN_LOCAL
@since{1.7.0}

Instead of creating an exportable key signature, create a key
signature which is is marked as non-exportable.

@item GPGME_KEYSIGN_LFSEP
@since{1.7.0}

Although linefeeds are uncommon in user IDs this flag is required to
explicitly declare that @var{userid} may contain several linefeed
separated user IDs.

@item GPGME_KEYSIGN_NOEXPIRE
Force the creation of a key signature without an expiration date.  This
overrides @var{expire} and any local configuration of the engine.

@item GPGME_KEYSIGN_FORCE
Force the creation of a new signature even if one already exists.
This flag has an effect only if the gpg version is at least 2.2.28 but
won't return an error with older versions.

@c  EXPORTING KEYS
@c
@node Exporting Keys
@subsection Exporting Keys
@cindex key, export
@cindex key ring, export from

Exporting keys means the same as running @command{gpg} with the command
@option{--export}.  However, a mode flag can be used to change the way
the export works.  The available mode flags are described below, they
may be or-ed together.

@table @code

@item GPGME_EXPORT_MODE_EXTERN
If this bit is set, the output is send directly to the default
keyserver. This is currently only allowed for OpenPGP keys.  It is good
practise to not send more than a few dozens key to a keyserver at one
time.  Using this flag requires that the @var{keydata} argument of the
export function is set to @code{NULL}.

@item GPGME_EXPORT_MODE_MINIMAL
@since{1.3.1}

If this bit is set, the smallest possible key is exported.  For OpenPGP
keys it removes all signatures except for the latest self-signatures.
For X.509 keys it has no effect.

@item GPGME_EXPORT_MODE_SSH
@since{1.4.0}

If this bit is set, the latest authentication key of the requested
OpenPGP key is exported in the OpenSSH public key format.  This
accepts just a single key; to force the export of a specific subkey
a fingerprint pattern with an appended exclamation mark may be used.

@item GPGME_EXPORT_MODE_SECRET
@since{1.6.0}

Instead of exporting the public key, the secret key is exported.  This
may not be combined with @code{GPGME_EXPORT_MODE_EXTERN}.  For X.509
the export format is PKCS#8.

@item GPGME_EXPORT_MODE_SECRET_SUBKEY
@since{1.17.0}

If this bit is set, then a secret subkey is exported.  The subkey to
export must be specified with fingerprint pattern with an appended
exclamation mark.  This is currently only allowed for OpenPGP keys.
This flag may not be combined with @code{GPGME_EXPORT_MODE_EXTERN}.
This flag is not supported by the export functions that take an array
of keys.

@item GPGME_EXPORT_MODE_RAW
@since{1.6.0}

If this flag is used with @code{GPGME_EXPORT_MODE_SECRET} for an X.509
key the export format will be changed to PKCS#1.  This flag may not be
used with OpenPGP.

@item GPGME_EXPORT_MODE_PKCS12
@since{1.6.0}

If this flag is used with @code{GPGME_EXPORT_MODE_SECRET} for an X.509
key the export format will be changed to PKCS#12 which also includes
the certificate.  This flag may not be used with OpenPGP.

The function @code{gpgme_op_import_keys} adds the keys described by
the @code{NULL} terminated array @var{keys} to the key ring of the
crypto engine used by @var{ctx}.  It is used to actually import and
make keys permanent which have been retrieved from an external source
(i.e. using @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_EXTERN}) earlier.  The external
keylisting must have been made with the same context configuration (in
particular the same home directory).  @footnote{Thus it is a
replacement for the usual workaround of exporting and then importing a
key to make an X.509 key permanent.}  Note that for OpenPGP this may
require another access to the keyserver over the network.

Only keys of the currently selected protocol of @var{ctx} are
considered for import.  Other keys specified by the @var{keys} are
ignored.  As of now all considered keys must have been retrieved using
the same method, i.e. the used key listing mode must be identical.

@tindex gpgme_interact_cb_t
The @code{gpgme_interact_cb_t} type is the type of functions which
@acronym{GPGME} calls if it a key interact operation is on-going.  The
status keyword @var{status} and the argument line @var{args} are
passed through by @acronym{GPGME} from the crypto engine.  An empty
string represents EOF.  The file descriptor @var{fd} is -1 for normal
status messages.  If @var{status} indicates a command rather than a
status message, the response to the command should be written to
@var{fd}.  The @var{handle} is provided by the user at start of
operation.

The function should return @code{GPG_ERR_FALSE} if it did not handle
the status code, @code{0} for success, or any other error value.

This is a bit vector giving a summary of the signature status.  It
provides an easy interface to a defined semantic of the signature

  @item GPGME_SIGSUM_VALID
  The signature is fully valid.

  @item GPGME_SIGSUM_GREEN
  The signature is good but one might want to display some extra
  information.  Check the other bits.

  @item GPGME_SIGSUM_RED
  The signature is bad. It might be useful to check other bits and
  display more information, i.e. a revoked certificate might not render a
  signature invalid when the message was received prior to the cause for
  the revocation.

  @item GPGME_SIGSUM_KEY_REVOKED
  The key or at least one certificate has been revoked.

  @item GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR
  This status indicates that the signature could be verified or that

  This status indicates that the signature is valid but expired.  For
  the combined result this status means that all signatures are valid
  and expired.

  @item GPG_ERR_KEY_EXPIRED
  This status indicates that the signature is valid but the key used to
  verify the signature has expired.  For the combined result this status
  means that all signatures are valid and all keys are expired.

  @item GPG_ERR_CERT_REVOKED
  This status indicates that the signature is valid but the key used
  to verify the signature has been revoked.  For the combined result
  this status means that all signatures are valid and all keys are

  @item GPG_ERR_BAD_SIGNATURE
  This status indicates that the signature is invalid.  For the combined
  result this status means that all signatures are invalid.

  @item GPG_ERR_NO_PUBKEY
  This status indicates that the signature could not be verified due to
  a missing key.  For the combined result this status means that all

This is true if the validity of the signature has been checked using the
chain model.  In the chain model the time the signature has been created
must be within the validity period of the certificate and the time the
certificate itself has been created must be within the validity period
of the issuing certificate.  In contrast the default validation model
checks the validity of signature as well at the entire certificate chain
at the current time.

When processing mails it is sometimes useful to extract the actual
mail address (the ``addr-spec'') from a string.  GPGME provides this
helper function which uses the same semantics as the internal
functions in GPGME and GnuPG:

@deftypefun @w{char *} gpgme_addrspec_from_uid (@w{const char *@var{uid}})

@since{1.7.1}

Return the mail address (called ``addr-spec'' in RFC-5322) from the
string @var{uid} which is assumed to be a user id (called ``address''
in RFC-5322).  All plain ASCII characters (i.e. those with bit 7
cleared) in the result are converted to lowercase.  Caller must free
the result using @code{gpgme_free}.  Returns @code{NULL} if no valid

@since{1.1.0}

The function @code{gpgme_sig_notation_clear} removes the notation data
from the context @var{ctx}.  Subsequent signing operations from this
context will not include any notation data.

Every context starts with an empty notation data list.
@end deftypefun

@since{1.1.0}

The function @code{gpgme_sig_notation_add} adds the notation data with
the name @var{name} and the value @var{value} to the context
@var{ctx}.

Subsequent signing operations will include this notation data, as well
as any other notation data that was added since the creation of the
context or the last @code{gpgme_sig_notation_clear} operation.

The arguments @var{name} and @var{value} must be @code{NUL}-terminated
strings in human-readable form.  The flag
@code{GPGME_SIG_NOTATION_HUMAN_READABLE} is implied
(non-human-readable notation data is currently not supported).  The
strings must be in UTF-8 encoding.

If @var{name} is @code{NULL}, then @var{value} should be a policy URL.

The function @code{gpgme_sig_notation_add} returns the error code
@code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the notation data could be added
successfully, @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if @var{ctx} is not a valid
pointer, or if @var{name}, @var{value} and @var{flags} are an invalid
combination.  The function also passes through any errors that are
reported by the crypto engine support routines.

The function @code{gpgme_op_encrypt} encrypts the plaintext in the
data object @var{plain} for the recipients @var{recp} and stores the
ciphertext in the data object @var{cipher} or writes it directly to the
file set with @code{gpgme_data_set_file_name} for the data object
@var{cipher}.  The type of the ciphertext created is determined by the
@acronym{ASCII} armor (or, if that is not set, by the encoding specified
for @var{cipher}) and the text mode attributes set for the context
@var{ctx}.

If the flag @code{GPGME_ENCRYPT_ARCHIVE} is set, then an encrypted
archive is created from the files and directories given as NUL-separated
list in the data object @var{plain} and returned in the data object
@var{cipher}.  The paths of the files and directories have to
be given as paths relative to the current working directory or relative
to the base directory set with @code{gpgme_data_set_file_name}.

@var{recp} must be a @code{NULL}-terminated array of keys.  The user
must keep references for all keys during the whole duration of the
call (but see @code{gpgme_op_encrypt_start} for the requirements with
the asynchronous variant).

The value in @var{flags} is a bitwise-or combination of one or
multiple of the following bit values:

@table @code
@item GPGME_ENCRYPT_ALWAYS_TRUST
The @code{GPGME_ENCRYPT_ALWAYS_TRUST} symbol specifies that all the
recipients in @var{recp} should be trusted, even if the keys do not
have a high enough validity in the keyring.  This flag should be used
with care; in general it is not a good idea to use any untrusted keys.

For the S/MIME (CMS) protocol this flag allows to encrypt to a
certificate without running any checks on the validity of the
certificate.

@item GPGME_ENCRYPT_NO_ENCRYPT_TO
@since{1.2.0}

The @code{GPGME_ENCRYPT_NO_ENCRYPT_TO} symbol specifies that no
default or hidden default recipients as configured in the crypto
backend should be included.  This can be useful for managing different
user profiles.

@item GPGME_ENCRYPT_NO_COMPRESS
@since{1.5.0}

The @code{GPGME_ENCRYPT_NO_COMPRESS} symbol specifies that the
plaintext shall not be compressed before it is encrypted.  This is
in some cases useful if the length of the encrypted message
may reveal information about the plaintext.

@item GPGME_ENCRYPT_PREPARE
@itemx GPGME_ENCRYPT_EXPECT_SIGN
The @code{GPGME_ENCRYPT_PREPARE} symbol is used with the UI Server
protocol to prepare an encryption (i.e. sending the
@code{PREP_ENCRYPT} command).  With the
@code{GPGME_ENCRYPT_EXPECT_SIGN} symbol the UI Server is advised to
also expect a sign command.

@item GPGME_ENCRYPT_SYMMETRIC
@since{1.7.0}

The @code{GPGME_ENCRYPT_SYMMETRIC} symbol specifies that the
output should be additionally encrypted symmetrically even
if recipients are provided. This feature is only supported
for the OpenPGP crypto engine.

@item GPGME_ENCRYPT_THROW_KEYIDS
@since{1.8.0}

The @code{GPGME_ENCRYPT_THROW_KEYIDS} symbols requests that the
identifiers for the decrption keys are not included in the ciphertext.
On the receiving side, the use of this flag may slow down the
decryption process because all available secret keys must be tried.
This flag is only honored for OpenPGP encryption.

@item GPGME_ENCRYPT_WRAP
@since{1.8.0}

The @code{GPGME_ENCRYPT_WRAP} symbol specifies that the input is an
OpenPGP message and not a plain data.  This is the counterpart to
@code{GPGME_DECRYPT_UNWRAP}.

@item GPGME_ENCRYPT_WANT_ADDRESS
@since{1.11.0}

The @code{GPGME_ENCRYPT_WANT_ADDRESS} symbol requests that all
supplied keys or key specifications include a syntactically valid mail
address.  If this is not the case the operation is not even tried and
the error code @code{GPG_ERR_INV_USER_ID} is returned.  Only the
address part of the key specification is conveyed to the backend.  As
of now the key must be specified using the @var{recpstring} argument
of the extended encrypt functions.  This feature is currently only
supported for the OpenPGP crypto engine.

@item GPGME_ENCRYPT_ARCHIVE
@since{1.19.0}

The @code{GPGME_ENCRYPT_ARCHIVE} symbol specifies that the input is a
NUL-separated list of file paths and directory paths that shall be
encrypted into an archive.  This feature is currently only supported
for the OpenPGP crypto engine and requires GnuPG 2.4.1.

@end table

If @code{GPG_ERR_UNUSABLE_PUBKEY} is returned, some recipients in
@var{recp} are invalid, but not all.  In this case the plaintext might
be encrypted for all valid recipients and returned in @var{cipher} (if
this happens depends on the crypto engine).  More information about
the invalid recipients is available with
@code{gpgme_op_encrypt_result}.

If @var{recp} is @code{NULL}, symmetric rather than public key
encryption is performed.  Symmetrically encrypted cipher text can be
deciphered with @code{gpgme_op_decrypt}.  Note that in this case the
crypto backend needs to retrieve a passphrase from the user.
Symmetric encryption is currently only supported for the OpenPGP
crypto backend.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the
ciphertext could be created successfully, @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if
@var{ctx}, @var{recp}, @var{plain} or @var{cipher} is not a valid
pointer, @code{GPG_ERR_UNUSABLE_PUBKEY} if @var{recp} contains some

This is an extended version of @code{gpgme_op_encrypt} with
@var{recpstring} as additional parameter.  If @var{recp} is NULL and
@var{recpstring} is not NULL, the latter is expected to be a linefeed
delimited string with the set of key specifications.  In contrast to
@var{recp} the keys are given directly as strings and there is no need
to first create key objects.  Leading and trailing white space is
remove from each line in @var{recpstring}.  The keys are then passed
verbatim to the backend engine.

For the OpenPGP backend several special keywords are supported to
modify the operation.  These keywords are given instead of a key
specification.  The currently supported keywords are:

@table @code
@item --hidden
@itemx --no-hidden
These keywords toggle between normal and hidden recipients for all
following key specifications.  When a hidden recipient is requested
the gpg option @option{-R} (or @option{-F} in file mode) is used
instead of @option{-r} (@option{-f} in file mode).

@item --file
@itemx --no-file
These keywords toggle between regular and file mode for all following
key specification.  In file mode the option @option{-f} or @option{-F}
is passed to gpg.  At least GnuPG version 2.1.14 is required to handle
these options.  The @code{GPGME_ENCRYPT_WANT_ADDRESS} flag is ignored
in file mode.

@item --
This keyword disables all keyword detection up to the end of the
string.  All keywords are treated as verbatim arguments.

@end table

To create a @var{recpstring} it is often useful to employ a strconcat
style function.  For example this function creates a string to encrypt
to two keys:

@example
char *
xbuild_recpstring (const char *key1, const char *key2)
@{
  char *result = gpgrt_strconcat ("--\n", key1, "\n", key2, NULL);
  if (!result)
    @{ perror ("strconcat failed"); exit (2); @}
  return result;
@}
@end example

Note the use of the double dash here; unless you want to specify a
keyword, it is a good idea to avoid any possible trouble with key
specifications starting with a double dash.  The used strconcat
function is available in Libgpg-error 1.28 and later; Libgpg-error
(aka Gpgrt) is a dependency of GPGME.  The number of arguments to
@code{gpgrt_strconcat} is limited to 47 but that should always be
sufficient.  In case a larger and non-fixed number of keys are to be
supplied the following code can be used:

@example
char *
xbuild_long_recpstring (void)

In this example @code{get_next_keyspec} is expected to return the next

large number of recipients is often questionable due to security
reasons and also for the technicality that all keys are currently
passed on the command line to @command{gpg} which has as a platform
specific length limitation.

@node Running other Programs
@subsection Running other Programs

GPGME features an internal subsystem to run the actual backend
engines.  Along with data abstraction object this subsystem can be
used to run arbitrary simple programs which even need not be related
to cryptographic features.  It may for example be used to run tools
which are part of the GnuPG system but are not directly accessible
with the GPGME API.

             @w{unsigned int @var{flags}})

@since{1.5.0}

The function @code{gpgme_op_spawn} runs the program @var{file} with
the arguments taken from the NULL terminated array @var{argv}.  If no
arguments are required @var{argv} may be given as @code{NULL}.  In the
latter case or if @code{argv[0]} is the empty string, GPGME uses the
basename of @var{file} for @code{argv[0]}.  The file descriptors
@code{stdin}, @code{stdout}, and @code{stderr} are connected to the
data objects @var{datain}, @var{dataout}, and @var{dataerr}.  If NULL
is passed for one of these data objects the corresponding file
descriptor is connected to @file{/dev/null}.

The value in @var{flags} is a bitwise-or combination of one or
multiple of the following bit values:

@table @code
@item GPGME_SPAWN_DETACHED
@since{1.5.0}

Under Windows this flag inhibits the allocation of a new console for
the program.  This is useful for a GUI application which needs to call
a command line helper tool.

@node Using the Assuan protocol
@subsection Using the Assuan protocol

The Assuan protocol can be used to talk to arbitrary Assuan servers.
By default it is connected to the GnuPG agent, but it may be connected
to arbitrary servers by using @code{gpgme_ctx_set_engine_info},
passing the location of the servers socket as @var{file_name}
argument, and an empty string as @var{home_dir} argument.

The Assuan protocol functions use three kinds of callbacks to transfer
data:

@deftp {Data type} {gpgme_error_t (*gpgme_assuan_data_cb_t) @
       (@w{void *@var{opaque}}, @w{const void *@var{data}}, @
        @w{size_t @var{datalen}})}

@since{1.2.0}

This callback receives any data sent by the server.  @var{opaque} is
the pointer passed to @code{gpgme_op_assuan_transact_start},
@var{data} of length @var{datalen} refers to the data sent.
@end deftp

@deftp {Data type} {gpgme_error_t (*gpgme_assuan_inquire_cb_t) @

@since{1.2.0}

This callback is used to provide additional data to the Assuan server.
@var{opaque} is the pointer passed to
@code{gpgme_op_assuan_transact_start}, @var{name} and @var{args}
specify what kind of data the server requested, and @var{r_data} is
used to return the actual data.

Note: Returning data is currently not implemented in @acronym{GPGME}.

@since{1.2.0}

This callback receives any status lines sent by the server.
@var{opaque} is the pointer passed to
@code{gpgme_op_assuan_transact_start}, @var{status} and @var{args}
denote the status update sent.

@node Checking for updates
@subsection How to check for software updates

The GnuPG Project operates a server to query the current versions of
software packages related to GnuPG.  GPGME can be used to
access this online database and check whether a new version of a
software package is available.

@deftp {Data type} {gpgme_query_swdb_result_t}
@since{1.8.0}

This is a pointer to a structure used to store the result of a
@code{gpgme_op_query_swdb} operation.  After success full call to that
function, you can retrieve the pointer to the result with
@code{gpgme_op_query_swdb_result}.  The structure contains the
following member:

@table @code
@item name
This is the name of the package.

@item iversion
The currently installed version or an empty string.  This value is
either a copy of the argument given to @code{gpgme_op_query_swdb} or
the version of the installed software as figured out by GPGME or GnuPG.

@item created
This gives the date the file with the list of version numbers has
originally be created by the GnuPG project.

@item retrieved
This gives the date the file was downloaded.

@item warning
If this flag is set either an error has occurred or some of the
information in this structure are not properly set.  For example if
the version number of the installed software could not be figured out,
the @code{update} flag may not reflect a required update status.

@item update
If this flag is set an update of the software is available.

@node Run Control
@section Run Control
@cindex run control
@cindex cryptographic operation, running

@acronym{GPGME} supports running operations synchronously and
asynchronously.  You can use asynchronous operation to set up a
context up to initiating the desired operation, but delay performing
it to a later point.

Furthermore, you can use an external event loop to control exactly
when @acronym{GPGME} runs.  This ensures that @acronym{GPGME} only
runs when necessary and also prevents it from blocking for a long
time.

@menu
* Waiting For Completion::        Waiting until an operation is completed.

@node Waiting For Completion
@subsection Waiting For Completion
@cindex cryptographic operation, wait for
@cindex wait for completion

@deftypefun gpgme_ctx_t gpgme_wait (@w{gpgme_ctx_t @var{ctx}}, @w{gpgme_error_t *@var{status}}, @w{int @var{hang}})
The function @code{gpgme_wait} continues the pending operation within
the context @var{ctx}.  In particular, it ensures the data exchange
between @acronym{GPGME} and the crypto backend and watches over the
run time status of the backend process.

If @var{hang} is true, the function does not return until the
operation is completed or cancelled.  Otherwise the function will not
block for a long time.

The error status of the finished operation is returned in @var{status}
if @code{gpgme_wait} does not return @code{NULL}.

The @var{ctx} argument can be @code{NULL}.  In that case,
@code{gpgme_wait} waits for any context to complete its operation.

@code{gpgme_wait} can be used only in conjunction with any context
that has a pending operation initiated with one of the
@code{gpgme_op_*_start} functions except @code{gpgme_op_keylist_start}
and @code{gpgme_op_trustlist_start} (for which you should use the
corresponding @code{gpgme_op_*_next} functions).  If @var{ctx} is
@code{NULL}, all of such contexts are waited upon and possibly
returned.  Synchronous operations running in parallel, as well as key
and trust item list operations, do not affect @code{gpgme_wait}.

In a multi-threaded environment, only one thread should ever call
@code{gpgme_wait} at any time, regardless of whether @var{ctx} is specified
or not.  This means that all calls to this function should be fully
synchronized by locking primitives.  It is safe to start asynchronous
operations while a thread is running in @code{gpgme_wait}.

The function returns the @var{ctx} of the context which has finished
the operation.  If @var{hang} is false, and the timeout expires,
@code{NULL} is returned and @code{*status} will be set to 0.  If an
error occurs, @code{NULL} is returned and the error is returned in
@code{*status}.
@end deftypefun


@node Using External Event Loops
@subsection Using External Event Loops
@cindex event loop, external

@acronym{GPGME} hides the complexity of the communication between the
library and the crypto engine.  The price of this convenience is that
the calling thread can block arbitrary long waiting for the data
returned by the crypto engine.  In single-threaded programs, in
particular if they are interactive, this is an unwanted side-effect.
OTOH, if @code{gpgme_wait} is used without the @var{hang} option being
enabled, it might be called unnecessarily often, wasting CPU time that
could be used otherwise.

The I/O callback interface described in this section lets the user
take control over what happens when.  @acronym{GPGME} will provide the
user with the file descriptors that should be monitored, and the
callback functions that should be invoked when a file descriptor is
ready for reading or writing.  It is then the user's responsibility to
decide when to check the file descriptors and when to invoke the
callback functions.  Usually this is done in an event loop, that also
checks for events in other parts of the program.  If the callback
functions are only called when the file descriptors are ready,
@acronym{GPGME} will never block.  This gives the user more control
over the program flow, and allows to perform other tasks when
@acronym{GPGME} would block otherwise.

By using this advanced mechanism, @acronym{GPGME} can be integrated
smoothly into GUI toolkits like GTK+ even for single-threaded
programs.

@deftp {Data type} {gpgme_error_t (*gpgme_io_cb_t) (@w{void *@var{data}}, @w{int @var{fd}})}
@tindex gpgme_io_cb_t
The @code{gpgme_io_cb_t} type is the type of functions which
@acronym{GPGME} wants to register as I/O callback handlers using the
@code{gpgme_register_io_cb_t} functions provided by the user.

@var{data} and @var{fd} are provided by @acronym{GPGME} when the I/O
callback handler is registered, and should be passed through to the
handler when it is invoked by the user because it noticed activity on
the file descriptor @var{fd}.

The callback handler always returns @code{0}, but you should consider
the return value to be reserved for later use.
@end deftp

@deftp {Data type} {gpgme_error_t (*gpgme_register_io_cb_t) (@w{void *@var{data}}, @w{int @var{fd}}, @w{int @var{dir}}, @w{gpgme_io_cb_t @var{fnc}}, @w{void *@var{fnc_data}}, @w{void **@var{tag}})}
@tindex gpgme_register_io_cb_t
The @code{gpgme_register_io_cb_t} type is the type of functions which can
be called by @acronym{GPGME} to register an I/O callback function
@var{fnc} for the file descriptor @var{fd} with the user.
@var{fnc_data} should be passed as the first argument to @var{fnc}
when the handler is invoked (the second argument should be @var{fd}).
If @var{dir} is 0, @var{fnc} should be called by the user when
@var{fd} is ready for writing.  If @var{dir} is 1, @var{fnc} should be
called when @var{fd} is ready for reading.

@var{data} was provided by the user when registering the
@code{gpgme_register_io_cb_t} function with @acronym{GPGME} and will always
be passed as the first argument when registering a callback function.
For example, the user can use this to determine the event loop to
which the file descriptor should be added.

@acronym{GPGME} will call this function when a crypto operation is
initiated in a context for which the user has registered I/O callback
handler functions with @code{gpgme_set_io_cbs}.  It can also call this
function when it is in an I/O callback handler for a file descriptor
associated to this context.

The user should return a unique handle in @var{tag} identifying this
I/O callback registration, which will be passed to the
@code{gpgme_register_io_cb_t} function without interpretation when the file

@deftp {Data type} {void (*gpgme_remove_io_cb_t) (@w{void *@var{tag}})}
The @code{gpgme_remove_io_cb_t} type is the type of functions which can be
called by @acronym{GPGME} to remove an I/O callback handler that was
registered before.  @var{tag} is the handle that was returned by the
@code{gpgme_register_io_cb_t} for this I/O callback.

@acronym{GPGME} can call this function when a crypto operation is in
an I/O callback.  It will also call this function when the context is
destroyed while an operation is pending.
@end deftp

@deftp {Data type} {enum gpgme_event_io_t}
@tindex gpgme_event_io_t
The @code{gpgme_event_io_t} type specifies the type of an event that is
reported to the user by @acronym{GPGME} as a consequence of an I/O
operation.  The following events are defined:

@table @code
@item GPGME_EVENT_START
The operation is fully initialized now, and you can start to run the
registered I/O callback handlers now.  Note that registered I/O
callback handlers must not be run before this event is signalled.
@var{type_data} is @code{NULL} and reserved for later use.

@item GPGME_EVENT_DONE
The operation is finished, the last I/O callback for this operation
was removed.  The accompanying @var{type_data} points to a
@code{struct gpgme_io_event_done_data} variable that contains the
status of the operation that finished.  This event is signalled after
the last I/O callback has been removed.

@item GPGME_EVENT_NEXT_KEY
In a @code{gpgme_op_keylist_start} operation, the next key was
received from the crypto engine.  The accompanying @var{type_data} is
a @code{gpgme_key_t} variable that contains the key with one reference
for the user.

@end table
@end deftp

@deftp {Data type} {void (*gpgme_event_io_cb_t) (@w{void *@var{data}}, @w{gpgme_event_io_t @var{type}}, @w{void *@var{type_data}})}
The @code{gpgme_event_io_cb_t} type is the type of functions which can be
called by @acronym{GPGME} to signal an event for an operation running
in a context which has I/O callback functions registered by the user.

@var{data} was provided by the user when registering the
@code{gpgme_event_io_cb_t} function with @acronym{GPGME} and will always be
passed as the first argument when registering a callback function.
For example, the user can use this to determine the context in which
this event has occurred.

@var{type} will specify the type of event that has occurred.
@var{type_data} specifies the event further, as described in the above
list of possible @code{gpgme_event_io_t} types.

@acronym{GPGME} can call this function in an I/O callback handler.

@table @code
@item gpgme_register_io_cb_t add
This is the function called by @acronym{GPGME} to register an I/O

@item void *add_priv
This is passed as the first argument to the @code{add} function when
it is called by @acronym{GPGME}.  For example, it can be used to
determine the event loop to which the file descriptor should be added.

@item gpgme_remove_io_cb_t remove
This is the function called by @acronym{GPGME} to remove an I/O
callback handler.  It must be specified.

@item gpgme_event_io_cb_t event
This is the function called by @acronym{GPGME} to signal an event for
an operation.  It must be specified, because at least the start event
must be processed.

@item void *event_priv
This is passed as the first argument to the @code{event} function when
it is called by @acronym{GPGME}.  For example, it can be used to
determine the context in which the event has occurred.

@node I/O Callback Example
@subsubsection I/O Callback Example

To actually use an external event loop, you have to implement the I/O
callback functions that are used by @acronym{GPGME} to register and
unregister file descriptors.  Furthermore, you have to actually
monitor these file descriptors for activity and call the appropriate
I/O callbacks.

The following example illustrates how to do that.  The example uses
locking to show in which way the callbacks and the event loop can
run concurrently.  For the event loop, we use a fixed array.  For a
real-world implementation, you should use a dynamically sized
structure because the number of file descriptors needed for a crypto
operation in @acronym{GPGME} is not predictable.

@example
#include <assert.h>
#include <errno.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <pthread.h>
#include <sys/types.h>
#include <gpgme.h>

/* The following structure holds the result of a crypto operation.  */
struct op_result
@{
  int done;
  gpgme_error_t err;
@};

/* The following structure holds the data associated with one I/O
callback.  */
struct one_fd
@{
  int fd;
  int dir;
  gpgme_io_cb_t fnc;
  void *fnc_data;
  void *loop;
@};

struct event_loop
@{
  pthread_mutex_t lock;
#define MAX_FDS 32
  /* Unused slots are marked with FD being -1.  */
  struct one_fd fds[MAX_FDS];
@};
@end example

The following functions implement the I/O callback interface.

@example
gpgme_error_t
add_io_cb (void *data, int fd, int dir, gpgme_io_cb_t fnc, void *fnc_data,
	   void **r_tag)
@{
  struct event_loop *loop = data;
  struct one_fd *fds = loop->fds;
  int i;

  pthread_mutex_lock (&loop->lock);
  for (i = 0; i < MAX_FDS; i++)
    @{
      if (fds[i].fd == -1)
	@{
	  fds[i].fd = fd;
	  fds[i].dir = dir;
	  fds[i].fnc = fnc;
	  fds[i].fnc_data = fnc_data;
	  fds[i].loop = loop;
	  break;
	@}
    @}
  pthread_mutex_unlock (&loop->lock);
  if (i == MAX_FDS)
    return gpg_error (GPG_ERR_GENERAL);
  *r_tag = &fds[i];
  return 0;
@}

void
remove_io_cb (void *tag)
@{
  struct one_fd *fd = tag;
  struct event_loop *loop = fd->loop;

  pthread_mutex_lock (&loop->lock);
  fd->fd = -1;
  pthread_mutex_unlock (&loop->lock);
@}

void
event_io_cb (void *data, gpgme_event_io_t type, void *type_data)
@{
  struct op_result *result = data;

  /* We don't support list operations here.  */
  if (type == GPGME_EVENT_DONE)
    @{
      result->done = 1;
      result->err = *type_data;
    @}
@}
@end example

The final missing piece is the event loop, which will be presented
next.  We only support waiting for the success of a single operation.

@example
int
do_select (struct event_loop *loop)
@{
  fd_set rfds;
  fd_set wfds;
  int i, n;
  int any = 0;
  struct timeval tv;
  struct one_fd *fdlist = loop->fds;

  pthread_mutex_lock (&loop->lock);
  FD_ZERO (&rfds);
  FD_ZERO (&wfds);
  for (i = 0; i < MAX_FDS; i++)
    if (fdlist[i].fd != -1)
      FD_SET (fdlist[i].fd, fdlist[i].dir ? &rfds : &wfds);
  pthread_mutex_unlock (&loop->lock);

  tv.tv_sec = 0;
  tv.tv_usec = 1000;

  do
    @{
      n = select (FD_SETSIZE, &rfds, &wfds, NULL, &tv);
    @}
  while (n < 0 && errno == EINTR);

  if (n < 0)
    return n;	/* Error or timeout.  */

  pthread_mutex_lock (&loop->lock);
  for (i = 0; i < MAX_FDS && n; i++)
    @{
      if (fdlist[i].fd != -1)
	@{
	  if (FD_ISSET (fdlist[i].fd, fdlist[i].dir ? &rfds : &wfds))
	    @{
	      assert (n);
	      n--;
	      any = 1;
              /* The I/O callback handler can register/remove callbacks,
                 so we have to unlock the file descriptor list.  */
              pthread_mutex_unlock (&loop->lock);
	      (*fdlist[i].fnc) (fdlist[i].fnc_data, fdlist[i].fd);
              pthread_mutex_lock (&loop->lock);
	    @}

@node Cancellation
@subsection Cancellation
@cindex cryptographic operation, aborting
@cindex cryptographic operation, cancelling
@cindex aborting operations
@cindex cancelling operations

Sometimes you do not want to wait for an operation to finish.
@acronym{GPGME} provides two different functions to achieve that.  The
function @code{gpgme_cancel} takes effect immediately.  When it
returns, the operation is effectively canceled.  However, it has some
limitations and can not be used with synchronous operations.  In
contrast, the function @code{gpgme_cancel_async} can be used with any
context and from any thread, but it is not guaranteed to take effect
immediately.  Instead, cancellation occurs at the next possible time
(typically the next time I/O occurs in the target context).

@deftypefun gpgme_ctx_t gpgme_cancel (@w{gpgme_ctx_t @var{ctx}})
@since{0.4.5}

The function @code{gpgme_cancel} attempts to cancel a pending
operation in the context @var{ctx}.  This only works if you use the
global event loop or your own event loop.

If you use the global event loop, you must not call @code{gpgme_wait}
during cancellation.  After successful
cancellation, you can call @code{gpgme_wait} (optionally waiting on
@var{ctx}), and the context @var{ctx} will appear as if it had
finished with the error code @code{GPG_ERR_CANCEL}.

If you use an external event loop, you must ensure that no I/O
callbacks are invoked for this context (for example by halting the
event loop).  On successful cancellation, all registered I/O callbacks
for this context will be unregistered, and a @code{GPGME_EVENT_DONE}
event with the error code @code{GPG_ERR_CANCEL} will be signalled.

The function returns an error code if the cancellation failed (in this
case the state of @var{ctx} is not modified).
@end deftypefun


@deftypefun gpgme_ctx_t gpgme_cancel_async (@w{gpgme_ctx_t @var{ctx}})
@since{1.1.7}

The function @code{gpgme_cancel_async} attempts to cancel a pending
operation in the context @var{ctx}.  This can be called by any thread
at any time after starting an operation on the context, but will not
take effect immediately.  The actual cancellation happens at the next
time GPGME processes I/O in that context.

The function returns an error code if the cancellation failed (in this
case the state of @var{ctx} is not modified).

@node Debugging
@appendix How to solve problems
@cindex debug
@cindex GPGME_DEBUG

Everyone knows that software often does not do what it should do and thus
there is a need to track down problems.  This is in particular true
for applications using a complex library like @acronym{GPGME} and of
course also for the library itself.  Here we give a few hints on how
to solve such problems.

First of all you should make sure that the keys you want to use are
installed in the GnuPG engine and are usable.  Thus the first test is
to run the desired operation using @command{gpg} or @command{gpgsm} on
the command line.  If you can't figure out why things don't work, you
may use @acronym{GPGME}'s built in trace feature.  This feature is
either enabled using the environment variable @code{GPGME_DEBUG} or,
if this is not possible, by calling the function
@code{gpgme_set_global_flag}.  The value is the trace level and
an optional file name.  If no file name is given the trace output is
printed to @code{stderr}.

@noindent
For example
@smallexample
GPGME_DEBUG=9:/home/user/mygpgme.log
@end smallexample
@noindent
(Note that under Windows you use a semicolon in place of the colon to
separate the fields.)

A trace level of 9 is pretty verbose and thus you may want to start
off with a lower level.  The exact definition of the trace levels and
the output format may change with any release; you need to check the
source code for details.  In any case the trace log should be helpful
to understand what is going going on.  Warning: The trace log may
reveal sensitive details like passphrases or other data you use in
your application.  If you are asked to send a log file, make sure that
you run your tests only with play data.

The trace function makes use of gpgrt's logging function and thus the
special @file{socket://} and @file{tcp://} files may be used.  Because
this conflicts with the use of colons to separate fields, the following
hack is used: If the file name contains the string @code{^//} all
carets are replaced by colons.  For example to log to TCP port 42042
this can be used:
@smallexample
GPGME_DEBUG=5:tcp^//127.0.0.1^42042
@end smallexample

@node Deprecated Functions
@appendix Deprecated Functions

For backward compatibility @acronym{GPGME} has a number of functions,
data types and constants which are deprecated and should not be used
anymore.  We document here those which are really old to help
understanding old code and to allow migration to their modern
counterparts.

@strong{Warning:} These interfaces will be removed in a future version
of @acronym{GPGME}.

Note: This function is deprecated, please use
@code{gpgme_op_interact} instead.

The function @code{gpgme_op_edit} processes the key @var{KEY}
interactively, using the edit callback function @var{FNC} with the
handle @var{HANDLE}.  The callback is invoked for every status and
command request from the crypto engine.  The output of the crypto
engine is written to the data object @var{out}.

Note that the protocol between the callback function and the crypto
engine is specific to the crypto engine and no further support in
implementing this protocol correctly is provided by @acronym{GPGME}.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the
edit operation completes successfully, @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if
@var{ctx} or @var{key} is not a valid pointer, and any error returned
by the crypto engine or the edit callback handler.

The function @code{gpgme_data_new_with_read_cb} creates a new
@code{gpgme_data_t} object and uses the callback function @var{readfunc}
to retrieve the data on demand.  As the callback function can supply
the data in any way it wants, this is the most flexible data type
@acronym{GPGME} provides.  However, it can not be used to write data.

The callback function receives @var{hook_value} as its first argument
whenever it is invoked.  It should return up to @var{count} bytes in
@var{buffer}, and return the number of bytes actually read in
@var{nread}.  It may return @code{0} in @var{nread} if no data is
currently available.  To indicate @code{EOF} the function should
return with an error code of @code{-1} and set @var{nread} to
@code{0}.  The callback function may support to reset its internal
read pointer if it is invoked with @var{buffer} and @var{nread} being
@code{NULL} and @var{count} being @code{0}.

The function returns the error code @code{GPG_ERR_NO_ERROR} if the
data object was successfully created, @code{GPG_ERR_INV_VALUE} if
@var{dh} or @var{readfunc} is not a valid pointer, and
@code{GPG_ERR_ENOMEM} if not enough memory is available.

@c
@c Key Signatures
@c
The signatures on a key are only available if the key was retrieved
via a listing operation with the @code{GPGME_KEYLIST_MODE_SIGS} mode
enabled, because it is expensive to retrieve all signatures of a key.

So, before using the below interfaces to retrieve the signatures on a
key, you have to make sure that the key was listed with signatures
enabled.  One convenient, but blocking, way to do this is to use the
function @code{gpgme_get_key}.

@deftp {Data type} gpgme_attr_t
The @code{gpgme_attr_t} type is used to specify a key signature
attribute.  The following attributes are defined:

@table @code
@item GPGME_ATTR_KEYID
This is the key ID of the key which was used for the signature.  It is
representable as a string.

@item GPGME_ATTR_ALGO
This is the crypto algorithm used to create the signature.  It is
representable as a string and as a number.  The numbers correspond to
the @code{enum gcry_pk_algos} values in the gcrypt library.

@item GPGME_ATTR_CREATED
This is the timestamp at creation time of the signature.  It is
representable as a number.

@item GPGME_ATTR_EXPIRE
This is the expiration time of the signature.  It is representable as
a number.

@item GPGME_ATTR_USERID
This is the user ID associated with the signing key.  The user ID is
representable as a number.

@item GPGME_ATTR_NAME
This is the name belonging to a user ID.  It is representable as a string.

@item GPGME_ATTR_EMAIL
This is the email address belonging to a user ID.  It is representable
as a string.

@item GPGME_ATTR_COMMENT
This is the comment belonging to a user ID.  It is representable as a
string.

@item GPGME_ATTR_KEY_REVOKED
This specifies if a key signature is a revocation signature.  It is
representable as a number, and is @code{1} if the key is revoked, and
@code{0} otherwise.

@c @item GPGME_ATTR_KEY_EXPIRED
@c This specifies if a key signature is expired.  It is representable as
@c a number, and is @code{1} if the key is revoked, and @code{0}
@c otherwise.
@c
@item GPGME_ATTR_SIG_CLASS
This specifies the signature class of a key signature.  It is
representable as a number.  The meaning is specific to the crypto
engine.

@item GPGME_ATTR_SIG_CLASS
This specifies the signature class of a key signature.  It is
