2002-02-02  Marcus Brinkmann  <marcus@g10code.de>

	This patch has gotten a bit large... mmh.  The main thing that
	happens here is that error values are now not determined in the
	operation function after gpgme_wait completed, but in the status
	handler when EOF is received.  It should always be the case that
	either an error is flagged or EOF is received, so that after a
	gpgme_wait you should never have the situation that no error is
	flagged and EOF is not received.  One problem is that the engine
	status handlers don't have access to the context, a horrible
	kludge works around this for now.  All errors that happen during a
	pending operation should be catched and reported in ctx->error,
	including out-of-core and cancellation.  This rounds up neatly a
	couple of loose ends, and makes it possible to pass up any errors
	in the communication with the backend as well.  As a bonus, there
	will be a function to access gpgme->wait, so that the operations
	can truly be implemented with their _start function.

	error back to the context.
