No ChangeLog file
=================

Do not modify the ChangeLog file of QGpgME.  Since QGpgME was added
to gpgme we put change information only in the GIT commit log, and
generate a top-level ChangeLog file from logs at "make dist" time.
As such, there are strict requirements on the form of the commit log
messages.  See doc/HACKING (of gpgme) for details.

Change information before QGpgME was added to gpgme can be found in
the KDE repositories from where QGpgME has been imported.
