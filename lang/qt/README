Qt API bindings/wrapper for GPGME
---------------------------------
Based on KF5gpgmepp QGpgME and libkleo/backends/qgpgme

Please note that QGpgME has a different license (GPL only)
then GPGME itself. See the License section in this
document for more information.

Overview
--------
QGpgME provides a very high level Qt API around GpgME++.
As such it depends on GpgME++ additionally to GpgME.

There are two general concepts in QGpgME. Data abstraction
through GpgME++'s Dataprovider interface and the Job pattern.

Data can be provided with QByteArrayDataProvider or
QIODeviceDataProvider which can be constructed from their
respective types. This means you can pass a QFile, QProcess,
QString, etc.. directly to GPGME.

To provide a stable API / ABI and because of historic reasons
in libkleo (Where QGpgME was originally developed as an abstract
crypto backend) QGpgME only provides abstract interfaces as
public API while the actual implementation happens in the
private QGpgME prefixed classes.

Usage
-----

To use QGpgME first you need to obtain a Protocol class
either for CMS (S/MIME) or OpenPGP. This Protocol class
can then be used to create a Job.

Each Job can be started asynchronously and emits a result
signal when done. The jobs are deleted automatically
with QObject::deleteLater so they can be started without
result handlers.

The result signal provides a tuple of objects with the
appropriate result information for this job. For historic
reasons each result signal also includes an AuditLog
and an AuditLog Error. These are only useful for
S/MIME signature validation but are part of other jobs
for API stability reasons.

Some jobs like the verification or decryption jobs have
dedicated result classes. Each result class at least
has the member function error() that can be used
to check if a job failed. Additionally errors are emitted
in the result signal.

Jobs also provide progress signal whenever GnuPG emits
a progress status line.

Most jobs also provide a way synchronously execute them.
Please not that synchronous use does not cause the autodeletion
to take place so you have to manually delete them.

Async usage:

    /* Create a job */
    EncryptJob *job = openpgp()->encryptJob(/*ASCII Armor */false, /* Textmode */ false);
    /* Connect something to the result signal */
    connect(job, &EncryptJob::result, this, [] (const GpgME::EncryptionResult &result,
                                                const QByteArray &cipherText,
                                                const QString,
                                                const GpgME::Error) {
        /* Handle the result / do something with the ciphertext */
     });
    /* Start the job */
    job->start(keys, inptr, outptr, Context::AlwaysTrust);
    /* Do not delete the job as it is autodeleted. */

Synchronous usage:

    /* Create a job */
    KeyListJob *listjob = openpgp()->keyListJob(false, false, false);
    /* Prepare result vector */
    std::vector<Key> keys;
    /* Execute it synchronusly */
    KeyListResult result = listjob->exec(QStringList() << QStringLiteral("alfa@example.net"),
                                         false, keys);
    /* Delete the job */
    delete listjob;
    /* Work with the result */

in QGpgME. (Subdir doc)

Examples / Tests
----------------

The tests in the tests subdir can be used to get a better
idea of QGpgME's usage. They also serve to test the C++
API. Kleopatra and KMails Messagelib also make extensive
use of QGpgME and can be used as further examples.
