/**
   @short An abstract base class for asynchronously listing all keys

   To use a ListAllKeysJob, first obtain an instance from the
   CryptoBackend implementation, connect the progress()
   and result() signals to suitable slots and then start the key
   listing with a call to start(). This call might fail, in which
   case the ListAllKeysJob instance will have schedules it's own
   destruction with a call to QObject::deleteLater().

   After result() is emitted, the ListAllKeysJob will schedule it's
   own destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().

   This is potentially much faster than a KeyListJob with empty
   pattern.
