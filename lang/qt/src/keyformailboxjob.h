   @short Get the best key to use for a Mailbox

   To use the keyformailboxjob, first obtain an instance from the
   CryptoBackend and either exec it or start and
   connect the result() signal to a suitable slot.

   The best key is defined as the key with a UID that has an
   E-Mail that matches the mailbox provided. If multiple
   keys are found the one with the highest validity is returned.

   After result() is emitted, the job will schedule it's own
   destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
