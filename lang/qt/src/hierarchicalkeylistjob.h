   @short A convenience job that additionally fetches all available issuers.

   To use a HierarchicalKeyListJob, pass it a CryptoBackend
   implementation, connect the progress() and result() signals to
   suitable slots and then start the keylisting with a call to
   start(). This call might fail, in which case the
   HierarchicalKeyListJob instance will have scheduled it's own
   destruction with a call to QObject::deleteLater().

   After result() is emitted, the HierarchicalKeyListJob will
   schedule its own destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
