   @short An abstract base class for asynchronous importers

   To use a ImportJob, first obtain an instance from the
   CryptoBackend implementation, connect the progress() and result()
   signals to suitable slots and then start the import with a call
   to start(). This call might fail, in which case the ImportJob
   instance will have scheduled it's own destruction with a call to
   QObject::deleteLater().

   After result() is emitted, the ImportJob will schedule it's own
   destruction by calling QObject::deleteLater().
