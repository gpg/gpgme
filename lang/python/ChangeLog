No ChangeLog file
=================

Do not modify the ChangeLog file of the Python bindings of GpgME.  We
put change information only in the GIT commit log, and generate a
top-level ChangeLog file from logs at "make dist" time.
As such, there are strict requirements on the form of the commit log
messages.  See doc/HACKING (of gpgme) for details.

Change information before the Python bindings were added to gpgme
can be found in doc/meta/old-commits.log.
