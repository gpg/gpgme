PyME - GPGME for Python                                      -*- org -*-
=======================

PyME is a python interface to the GPGME library:
https://www.gnupg.org/related_software/gpgme/

PyME offers two interfaces, one is a high-level, curated, and
idiomatic interface that is implemented as a shim on top of the
low-level interface automatically created using SWIG.

This way we make simple things easy, while still providing the entire
functionality of the underlying library.
