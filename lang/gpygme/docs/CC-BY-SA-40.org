*Using Creative Commons Public Licenses*

Creative Commons public licenses provide a standard set of terms and
conditions that creators and other rights holders may use to share
original works of authorship and other material subject to copyright and
certain other rights specified in the public license below. The
following considerations are for informational purposes only, are not
exhaustive, and do not form part of our licenses.

#+BEGIN_QUOTE
  *Considerations for licensors:* Our public licenses are intended for
  use by those authorized to give the public permission to use material
  in ways otherwise restricted by copyright and certain other rights.
  Our licenses are irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand the
  terms and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.
  Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before applying our
  licenses so that the public can reuse the material as expected.
  Licensors should clearly mark any material not subject to the license.
  This includes other CC-licensed material, or material used under an
  exception or limitation to copyright.

  *Considerations for the public:* By using one of our public licenses,
  a licensor grants the public permission to use the licensed material
  under specified terms and conditions. If the licensor's permission is
  not necessary for any reason--for example, because of any applicable
  exception or limitation to copyright--then that use is not regulated
  by the license. Our licenses grant only permissions under copyright
  and certain other rights that a licensor has authority to grant. Use
  of the licensed material may still be restricted for other reasons,
  including because others have copyright or other rights in the
  material. A licensor may make special requests, such as asking that
  all changes be marked or described. Although not required by our
  licenses, you are encouraged to respect those requests where
  reasonable.

   *Unless otherwise separately undertaken by the Licensor, to the
   extent possible, the Licensor offers the Licensed Material as-is and
   as-available, and makes no representations or warranties of any kind
   concerning the Licensed Material, whether express, implied,
   statutory, or other. This includes, without limitation, warranties of
   title, merchantability, fitness for a particular purpose,
   non-infringement, absence of latent or other defects, accuracy, or
   the presence or absence of errors, whether or not known or
   discoverable. Where disclaimers of warranties are not allowed in full
   or in part, this disclaimer may not apply to You.*

     <div id="s5b">
   #+END_HTML

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     </div>
   #+END_HTML

   *To the extent possible, in no event will the Licensor be liable to
   You on any legal theory (including, without limitation, negligence)
   or otherwise for any direct, special, indirect, incidental,
   consequential, punitive, exemplary, or other losses, costs, expenses,
   or damages arising out of this Public License or use of the Licensed
   Material, even if the Licensor has been advised of the possibility of
   such losses, costs, expenses, or damages. Where a limitation of
   liability is not allowed in full or in part, this limitation may not
   apply to You.*

   The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided
   above shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent possible,
   most closely approximates an absolute disclaimer and waiver of all
   liability.

*Section 6 -- Term and Termination.*

1. 

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <div id="s6a">
   #+END_HTML

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     </div>
   #+END_HTML

   This Public License applies for the term of the Copyright and Similar
   Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to comply with this Public
   License, then Your rights under this Public License terminate
   automatically.
2. 

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <div id="s6b">
   #+END_HTML

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     </div>
   #+END_HTML

   Where Your right to use the Licensed Material has terminated under
   Section [[#s6a][6(a)]], it reinstates:

   1. 

      #+BEGIN_HTML
        <div id="s6b1">
      #+END_HTML

      #+BEGIN_HTML
        </div>
      #+END_HTML

      automatically as of the date the violation is cured, provided it
      is cured within 30 days of Your discovery of the violation; or
   2. 

      #+BEGIN_HTML
        <div id="s6b2">
      #+END_HTML

      #+BEGIN_HTML
        </div>
      #+END_HTML

      upon express reinstatement by the Licensor.

   For the avoidance of doubt, this Section [[#s6b][6(b)]] does not
   affect any right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for Your
   violations of this Public License.

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <div id="s6c">
   #+END_HTML

     </div>
   #+END_HTML

   For the avoidance of doubt, the Licensor may also offer the Licensed
   Material under separate terms or conditions or stop distributing the
   Licensed Material at any time; however, doing so will not terminate
   this Public License.

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <div id="s6d">
   #+END_HTML

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     </div>

     <div id="s8a">
   #+END_HTML

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     </div>

   For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and shall
   not be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose conditions
   on any use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully be made
   without permission under this Public License.
2. 

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     <div id="s8b">
   #+END_HTML

   #+BEGIN_HTML
     </div>
   #+END_HTML

   To the extent possible, if any provision of this Public License is
   deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed to the
   minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision
   cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License
   without affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and
   conditions.
